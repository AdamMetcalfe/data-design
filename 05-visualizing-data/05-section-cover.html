  <h1>Visualizing Data</h1>
  <p>You finally have everything collected, prepped, and cleaned.  It’s time to cook - or bake, if you prefer!  When you’re combining ingredients, some will stand out in your dish, some will play a supporting role, and others, like baking soda or cornstarch, will get mixed in and seemingly fade away. You need to make sure each is handled and incorporated properly for the dish to succeed.</p>
  
  <p>It's also important to think about how to present the dish.  Some choices are a matter of focus, like when you want to highlight a few star ingredients.   Some choices are functional, like when you serve a cake with a slice removed so you can display all the layers inside.  Some choices still are based on appropriateness or lack thereof; if you serve soup on a flat cake plate, it will run all over the table.</p>
  
  <p>Some variables will stand out in your visualization while others, similar to baking soda in a recipe, may be used in the calculation of other figures but will themselves disappear into the end result.  The overall narrative that your visualization supports will help determine what presentations will show your data the best, while your data will dictate which graph types are possible.  (Just as you’ll run into problems delivering soup on a cake plate, you’ll have trouble if you try to present data using an incompatible graph type!)  You also need to consider elements like what fonts, colors, and icons you want to use.</p>
  
  <p>In this section, we’ll talk about crafting visualizations that help you best tell the story of your data, including tips for deciding what to visualize, what graph types make sense, and also how to give your creation the proper finishing touches so you’ll have a beautiful, accurate presentation of your information that your audience will be excited to consume.</p>
