  <h1>Visualizing Data</h1>
  <p>You finally have your ingredients collected, prepped, and cleaned.  Now it’s time to cook - or bake, if you prefer!  When you’re combining ingredients, some will stand out in your dish, some will play a supporting role, and others, like baking soda or cornstarch, will get mixed in and seemingly fade away.</p>
  <p>It has been said that you eat with your eyes first, so it’s important to think about how you present the ingredients as well.  Some choices are a matter of focus. You might want to highlight a few star ingredients, like the vegetables you took the time to perfectly slow-roast.  Some choices are preference in visual presentation.  You could choose to serve a cake whole, in slices, or even still with just one slice removed to show all the layers inside.  Some choices still are based on practical function.  You couldn’t serve soup on a flat cake plate; it would run all over the table.  You could serve a pie in a gravy boat, but it might appear to be more of a cobbler and less of a pie that way.</p>
  <p>Some variables will be the stand-out ingredients in your visualization while others, similar to baking soda in a recipe, may be used in the calculation of descriptive statistics that you’re featuring, but will themselves disappear into the end result.  The overall narrative that your visualization is supporting will help determine what kinds of presentations will show your data the best, while your data will help guide which graph types are even possible.  Just as you’ll run into problems delivering soup on a cake plate, you’ll encounter trouble trying to present data in a graph type that wasn’t meant to hold it.  You also need to consider elements like the fonts, colors, and icons you’ll use, as these are all part of your overall presentation.</p>
  <p>In this section, we’ll talk about strategies for crafting visualizations that help you best tell the story of your data, including tips for deciding what to visualize, details about what graph types make sense, and also how to give your creation the proper finishing touches so you’ll have a beautiful, accurate depiction of your information that your audience will be excited to consume.</p>
