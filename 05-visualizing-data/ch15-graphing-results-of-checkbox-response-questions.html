<h1>Checkbox responses</h1>

<p>This chapter focuses on checkbox responses or multiple response questions, where a question can be answered with more than one answer, if applicable. </p>

<h2>Refresher on the difference between checkboxes and radio buttons</h2>

<p>Let's say you're doing a survey and you're interested in what multimedia devices your respondents have used over the last 6 months. You would use a checkbox response question if you wanted to find out what all the devices were that people used over the six-month period. A radio button only allows respondents to select a single answer, so you could only use it to find out, for example, which one device a person used most often during the six-month period. Each type of question has merit, it just depends on what the purpose of your question is and how you are going to use the results. </p>


<h2>How checkbox answers are received</h2>

<p>In the example below, we asked, &ldquo;Which of the following electronic devices have you used in the past 6 months? Please select all that apply.&rdquo; The premise behind the question is that it&rsquo;s likely that a respondent could use more than one electronic device over a 6-month period, such as a cell phone and a tablet.</p>

<p>How your results or raw data are compiled will, of course, depend on the program you are using to program your survey. One of the more common formats is what you would see in an Excel spreadsheet.</p>


<p>An example of how the results to our question on electronic devices could be displayed is shown in the table below. A &ldquo;1&rdquo; is shown when a device is selected and a &ldquo;0&rdquo; if a device is not selected.</p>

<h2>How results of checkbox questions are special</h2>

<p>Let's take a look at a summary of possible responses to the checkbox question posed above.</p>
<table class="tableizer-table">
	<tbody>
		<tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
			<th>Table 1 Electronic Devices Used</th>
			<th>Total</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>PC</td>
			<td>421 (84%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Mac (desktop)</td>
			<td>300 (60%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Tablet (any kind)</td>
			<td>285 (57%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>iPad</td>
			<td>185 (37%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Laptop</td>
			<td>200 (40%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Cell phone (any kind)</td>
			<td>450 (90%)</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>You may notice that the total number of responses (1,841) is greater than the number of people that did the survey (N=500)! Why? Well, when you ask a checkbox question, you're not really asking just one thing; you're asking a <em>series</em> of yes/no questions. A respondent checks a box if an answer choice applies and leaves it blank if it doesn't. The total possible number of checked boxes?  (# of "real" answer options) X (# of respondents)  (Here, a "real" answer option means one that isn't "None," "N/A" or "Prefer not to Answer," since selecting one of those options would prevent a person from choosing any other answers in additional to that.)</p>

<p>There are a few different ways to illustrate these findings, depending on what your overall question of interest is. One way is to do a bar graph and base the percentages on the number of respondents that selected each answer choice, like in the graph below. Clearly, cellphones (90%) and PCs (84%) are the most commonly-cited electronic devices used in the past six months. </p>

<p>However, the fact that the total adds to more than 100% can be unsettling for some. An alternative way to illustrate the results is to base the percentages on the total mentions (1,841).</p>

<figure><img alt="Electronic devices used" src="../images/sections/05/electronic-devices-used-1b.png" /></figure>

<p>A drawback to this way of displaying data is one must always keep in mind that it is based on mentions not people, so one can&rsquo;t say, for example, &lsquo;24% of consumers used a cellphone in the past six months&rsquo;. {we need a better example here of when this could be an advantage, a case where mentions might be okay to use and not just confusing}</p>




<h2>Attitudinal Measurements</h2>

<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve been looking at the use of checkbox questions to gather data on basic counts (e.g. electronic devices used). Checkbox responses can also be used to assess agreement with <a class="glossterm" target="_blank" href="glossary01.html#statement-attitudinal">attitudinal statements</a>. The graph below shows attitudes of homeowners towards owning their home. In this case, since the statistic of interest is what percentage of homeowners agree with each statement, it is probably best to keep the graph as is, with the total exceeding 100%.</p>

<h2>How to display the results</h2>

<p>So far we&rsquo;ve been displaying the results for checkbox responses in bar graphs for one point in time.</p>

<h3>Point in time</h3>

<p>Other ways of displaying the results for a specific point in time include:</p>

<figure><img alt="Column chart for checkboxes" src="../images/sections/05/checkbox-column.png" /></figure>

<h3>Over time</h3>

<p>If your checkbox responses have been collected over a period of time, say 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, you could display the responses as shown below.</p>
