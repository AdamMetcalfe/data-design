<h1>Graphing the Results of Checkbox Responses</h1>

<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>Checkbox responses</h1>

<p>This chapter focuses on checkbox responses or multiple response questions, where a question can be answered with more than one answer, if applicable. In the example below, we asked, &ldquo;Which of the following electronic devices have you used in the past 6 months? Please select all that apply.&rdquo; The premises behind the question is that it&rsquo;s likely that a respondent could use more than one electronic device over a 6-month period, such as a cell phone and a tablet.</p>

<table class="tableizer-table">
	<tbody>
		<tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
			<th>Table 1 Electronic Devices Used</th>
			<th>Total</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>PC</td>
			<td>421 (84%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Mac (desktop)</td>
			<td>300 (60%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Tablet (any kind)</td>
			<td>285 (57%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>iPad</td>
			<td>185 (37%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Laptop</td>
			<td>200 (40%)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Cell phone (any kind)</td>
			<td>450 (90%)</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>You will also notice that the total to all the answers above (1,841) equal more than the 500 respondents.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to illustrate these findings.</p>

<p>One way is to show the data as reported (Graph 1A below). Clearly, cellphones (90%) and PCs (84%) are the most commonly-cited electronic devices used in the past six months (Note: These results are purely fictional). Another thing to note is that the order of the devices has been changed so they are in descending order, beginning with the largest. This is important in communicating the results in an easy-to-understand manner.</p>

<figure><img alt="Electronic devices used" src="../images/sections/05/electronic-devices-used-1a.png" /></figure>

<p>But the fact that the total adds to more than 100% can be unsettling for some. An alternative way to illustrate the results is to base the percentages on the total mentions (1,841).</p>

<figure><img alt="Electronic devices used" src="../images/sections/05/electronic-devices-used-1b.png" /></figure>

<p>A drawback to this way of displaying data is one must always keep in mind that it is based on mentions not people, so one can&rsquo;t say, for example, &lsquo;24% of consumers used a cellphone in the past six months&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Comparison of Checkbox Responses and Single-Choice Questions</h2>

<p>So, you can use a checkbox response question if you want to find, in our example, all the devices one could use over a six-month period. In contrast, a single-choice question would see to find out which one device a person uses most often in a six-month period. Each type of question has merit, it just depends on what you want to find out (what are your objectives) and how you are going to use the results. The graphs below compare results from a checkbox response question and a single-choice question.</p>

<figure><img alt="Comparing checkbox and radio responses" src="../images/sections/05/checkbox-vs-radio.png" /></figure>

<p>Another difference between single choice and checkbox responses is that in the former type of question, if you want to change your answer you just select another answer and your first answer is automatically de-selected. For checkbox responses, you must select your incorrect answer again in order to de-select it.</p>

<h2>Other Ways of Using Checkbox Responses</h2>

<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve been looking at simple measurement attributes (e.g. electronic devices used). Checkbox responses can also be based on <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#statement-attitudinal">attitudinal statements</a>. The graph below shows attitudes of homeowners towards owning their home. In this case, you probably want to keep it as is, where the total exceeds 100%. It&rsquo;s a quasi-qualitative question and you want to see the full range of attitudes.</p>

<figure><img alt="Home ownership bar graph" src="../images/sections/05/home-ownership.png" /></figure>

<h2>Writing checkbox response questions</h2>

<p>Here are a few tips for writing this type of question:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Randomize answer options to help prevent <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#bias-order">order bias</a></p>

	<blockquote>Order bias are survey bias by which responses can be affected by the order of answer choices. Respondents tend to favour responses at the beginning and at the end of a list because they are more memorized. First items may also be chosen by respondents to save time.
	<p data-type="attribution"><a href="http://digitalmarketing-glossary.com/What-is-Order-bias-definition)" target="_blank">The Digital Marketing Glossary</a></p>
	</blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>If there is any change that a respondent won&rsquo;t be able to answer the question (&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say&rdquo; or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;), might not want to answer the question (&ldquo;prefer not to say&rdquo;) or might have an answer different from any of the answers provided (&ldquo;other&rdquo;) ut this option at the bottom of the list and anchor it or make sure it always appears as the last option.</li>
	<li>If you have a &ldquo;none&rdquo; option, make sure it is exclusive, that is, if it is selected, all other options are automatically de-selected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How checkbox answers are received</h2>

<p>How your results or raw data are compiled will, of course, depend on the program you are using to program your survey. One of the more common formats is what you would see in an Excel spreadsheet.</p>

<p>So going back to our question on electronic devices:</p>

<blockquote>Which of the following electronic devices have you used in the past 6 months? Select all that apply.</blockquote>

<p>An example of how the results to our question on electronic devices could be displayed is shown in the table below. A &ldquo;1&rdquo; is shown when a device is selected and a &ldquo;0&rdquo; if a device is not selected.</p>

<p>When the results are displayed like this, it makes it easy to see which devices are used most. It also makes it easy to see how many respondents are not connect (selected &ldquo;none&rsquo;), an interesting finding in itself.</p>

<h2>Order of mentions</h2>

<p>When programing your question, you may want to consider which device was selected first, second, third, etc. This information os often used in marketing to help determine which devices are &ldquo;top of mind&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>How to display the results</h2>

<p>So far we&rsquo;ve been displaying the results for checkbox responses in bar graphs for one point in time.</p>

<h3>Point in time</h3>

<p>Other ways of displaying the results for a specific point in time include:</p>

<h3>Over time</h3>

<p>If your checkbox responses have been collected over a period of time, say 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, you could display the responses as shown below.</p>
