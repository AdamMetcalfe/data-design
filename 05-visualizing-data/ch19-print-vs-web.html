<h1>Print Vs. Web, Static Vs. Interactive</h1>
</header>

<section data-type="sect1">
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re designing graphics for static environments or for interactive ones, it&rsquo;s important to assess a few key things up front. First of all, what do we mean by static and interactive?</p>

<h2>Defining print vs. web, static vs. interactive</h2>

<p>You can design <a class="glossterm" target="_blank" href="glossary01.html#graphic-static">static graphics</a> for print or the web, or both. With static graphics, you&rsquo;ll provide everything you want your viewers to see without requiring any input from them. The most a static image demands from a viewer is to turn a page or scroll, or perhaps enlarge an image. Typically, static graphics display information that isn&rsquo;t changing.</p>

<p>You can also design interactive graphics for print or the web, or both. <a class="glossterm" target="_blank" href="glossary01.html#graphic-interactive">Interactive graphics</a> provide viewers the option to dive deeper into the information, often requiring some degree of input. Now, you may be thinking, &ldquo;Interactive print?&rdquo; Actually, yes, though of course it&rsquo;s not as common as interactive graphics on the web. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a class="link " href="http://civic.mit.edu/postmarked" target="_blank">Postmarked</a>, a project that invited neighbors and frequent passersby to send postcards to the property owners of an empty building for the purpose of encouraging dialogue about unused spaces. The postcards invited interaction--draw or write, then mail, and respond--and communicated unique pieces of information about the space.</li>
	<li>Art installations</li>
	<li>Flip books/analog animations</li>
	<li>Popup books</li>
</ul>

<p>So, static isn&rsquo;t a stand-in for print, nor is interactive a stand-in for web.</p>

<p>One more thing: the antonym to static isn&rsquo;t interactive. It&rsquo;s changing, moving, or dynamic. <a class="glossterm" target="_blank" href="glossary01.html#graphic-motion">Motion graphics</a> don&rsquo;t require viewer interaction, but they&rsquo;re not static, either. Any given cable news network will give you examples of these. Do they display necessary information? Not usually. Putting motion on information graphics can keep viewers&rsquo; attention, at least at first. But over the course of a segment or a show, viewer fatigue sets in. Motion graphics often look impressive, but always ask whether motion is necessary for conveying the information, and be wary of overusing it.</p>

<p>For more details on interactive web graphics, see the &ldquo;Interactivity and staticness&rdquo; section below.</p>

<h2>Basic concepts: color, size, layout, interactivity</h2>

<h3>Color</h3>

<p>As for color, there are a lot of questions to take into consideration before you break out your palette, especially if you&rsquo;re working in print. Are you working with full color or black and white? If you&rsquo;re working with color, consider what you&rsquo;re gaining that makes it worth the cost difference from black and white. After all, grayscale and two-tone printing can still communicate a lot of information. Is a full-color print job really necessary?</p>

<p>How many colors are available for the print job? What kind of paper are you working with? Colors work differently with news print, magazine, or printer paper. Or are you getting fancy and putting the graphic on merchandise? A good merchandising company will work with you to make sure your t-shirts, totes, buttons, or stickers look great, but you&rsquo;ll want to anticipate these concerns in advance.</p>

<p>On the web, a lot of these restrictions go away, but not all. Many designers have to work within a website&rsquo;s color palette. They have to ask questions such as: does the website&rsquo;s green color scheme completely clash with this bright pink graphic? Does it subtly complement the branding and logo design? The answers to each of these can have an impact on how the viewer receives the final design.</p>

<h3>Size</h3>

<p>Step back and take a look at the space you&rsquo;re working with. You have to consider size for both print and the web, but print demands more defined physical constraints.</p>

<p>On the web, even if the space allotted for your graphic is small, you can often include image-enlarging functionality, or ensure viewers can open a larger version of the graphic in a separate tab or window. This frees you up to include more information in the graphic without worrying as much about the frame or font size. In instances where you need the full-size graphic on the original webpage, though, you&rsquo;ll be under the same constraints as with print.</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>

<p>With static images, the point is to provide everything you want to convey in one or more frames. There are no mouseovers, you can&rsquo;t click around and select certain details and un-select certain others (e.g., show only state rodeos from 1988 to 1996). Position your information so that it&rsquo;s all visible at the same time. This might influence your choice of graphic type (chart or graph?), positioning (horizontal or vertical?), and how many graphics you&rsquo;ll use.</p>

<p>With interactive graphics, make sure to leave room for any clickable controls that manage the interaction. Are there buttons or slides off to the side, or are they a part of the graphic? Does the viewer have to scroll around to see everything with several options engaged? Test your graphic in different browsers to make sure it all fits--and functions--the way you want.</p>

<p>A note on static graphics on the web: they aren&rsquo;t necessarily interactive, except that viewers can enlarge them, as mentioned above. Because the graphic itself doesn&rsquo;t change, the main considerations of layout still apply. But just by being on the web, static graphics give us more interactivity than print. For example, they can be linked to their data source, another related graph, or a different web page.</p>

<p>Good examples of static graphics on the web:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Extremely simple graphs can give us some insight into complicated topics, like chronobiology.</li>
	<li>Or they can help visualize clear points on not-so-complicated topics, such as how much Hollywood earns.</li>
	<li>They can also point out indications based on a collection of data, such as whether a drought seems likely based on average rainfall in a given area over decades.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interactivity and staticness</h3>

<p>Making interactive graphics is getting easier all the time with new software and applications. Interactivity can be not only extremely impressive but useful, too, highlighting different types of information so much better than a static image ever could. But sometimes, you&rsquo;ll come across an interactive image that actually makes the information more confusing. Other times, you&rsquo;ll come across an interactive image that seems neat at first, but as you play with it, you realize it&rsquo;s just bells and whistles. You&rsquo;re not learning anything new, and the information could just as clearly have been presented in a static image. What a let-down!</p>

<p>Why spend time making a graphic interactive when it doesn&rsquo;t need it? Interactivity is a tool in the designer&rsquo;s toolbox just like staticness is. Interactivity should be used when it improves upon a static graphic, or adds value to the information and does something that the static image alone could not.</p>

<p>Examples of interactive graphics that make information easier to understand than a static graphic, or does a better job of illustrating a point:</p>

<ul>

	<li><a href="http://hosted.ap.org/interactives/2013/ethanol/" target="_blank">Conservation Land and Corn Production</a> (AP, 2013)</li>
	<li>(**More examples to mine here: <a href="http://datajournalism.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">http://datajournalism.stanford.edu/</a> )</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of interactive graphics that obscures information or makes it harder to understand:</p>

<p>In static graphics, you can&rsquo;t rely on visual effects like movement or color changes to make your point. On the other hand, while interactive graphics can incorporate visual effects to show trends across time, they do introduce room for technical difficulties. Be mindful of compatibility in computer systems and across browsers.</p>

<p>The best way to prepare for any bugs is to have a backup: design a version of your graphic that conveys the same information effectively in static form, in case the reader isn&rsquo;t able to view the interactive graphic. This method may seem like twice the work, but it&rsquo;s rarely not worth it. You&rsquo;ll be rewarded with an inside-out understanding of the information, leading to a better overall design no matter the format.</p>
