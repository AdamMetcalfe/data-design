<p>What is color? Color is a sensation, a perception, not a physical thing. It is a construct of the brain, resulting from the biomechanics of vision. Light is the source of all color, resulting from the different wave lengths present in white light. Sir Isaac Newton, through his experimentations filtering light through a prism, identified seven main wavelengths responsible for producing the following colors: red, blue, yellow, green, orange, violet and indigo. White is the presence of all colors on the spectrum, while the absence of all color is black.</p>

<p>When light is projected onto an object, the wave lengths of that light are either absorbed or reflected, based on the physical properties of the object. The wave lengths not absorbed are processed by the light receptors of the human retina as color. Take an apple, for example. An apple itself is not red (or yellow or green). But rather, It possesses a certain chemical makeup that dictates which colors of the spectrum it absorbs or reflects. The red we see when we look at an apple is not a physical attribute of the apple itself. It&rsquo;s an attribute of the light it reflects. The wave length not absorbed is red, and therefore, the one our brain perceives.</p>

<p>Like the question &quot;If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?&quot; we can pose similar philosophical questions about color. For color to exist, it relies on three things coinciding at the same time: light, an object, and a viewer. In the absence of light, there is no color. In the absence of an object, there is no color. In the absence of a viewer there is no color.</p>

<h2>Color and Meaning</h2>

<p>Different colors mean different things to different people; one person might cherish a certain color because it&rsquo;s associated with someone or something they love. Different colors in different cultures mean different things to an entire nation; in China, white symbolizes mourning. Consequently, Chinese brides do not wear white wedding dresses.</p>

<p>Different colors in different contexts mean different things depending on where, when, and how they&rsquo;re used. For example, red and green in the context of American store displays in November and December mean Christmas. Red and green in the context of an international grocery store mean Italian. Red and green in the context of p light mean stop and go, but in a KPI graph in an infographic, they mean up or down, bad or good.</p>

<p>When creating data visualizations and infographics, knowing a little about color theory and how an audience interprets color are powerful things, allowing more effective and efficient communication.</p>

<h2>Basic Color Theory</h2>

<p>Basic <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#theory-color">color theory</a> is fairly straightforward; simple in theory but much more complicated in practical application. For art and design students, color theory is a required field of study and for good reason. Mastering the basics of applied color theory provides a powerful tool for visual communication.</p>

<p>In their most fundamental elements, colors are described via hue, value, and chroma. <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#hue">Hue</a> is the base color: red, blue, green, etc. <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#color-value">Value</a> (brightness) refers to the tint, shade, or tone of a hue, resulting from the addition of black and/or white to the base color: pink is a <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#tint">tint</a> of red, plum is a <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#shade">shade</a> of purple. <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#chroma">Chroma</a> (brilliance) is the brightness or saturation of a color; pastels being an example of low chromatic color variations.</p>

<h2>Using Color for Data Visualization</h2>

<p>When it comes to using color effectively in data visualizations, form follows function. It&rsquo;s important to define the story you&rsquo;re telling with your data and then use color as a vehicle for this storytelling.</p>

<p>John Snow&rsquo;s simple data visualization of cholera cases in London worked beautifully and effectively in black and white. But using color strategically can add another layer of meaning to a data visualization, providing a richer, more intuitive read. Adding color to the Snow map to differentiate the wells and highlight clusters of cholera cases around each well makes the data more readily understandable.</p>

<p>Organizational schemes for data can be reduced to five basic dimensions known as LATCH: Location, Alphabet, Time, Category and Hierarchy&nbsp;Exploring data via these principles makes it clear to see how color enhances data. But only when it&rsquo;s used well. There are a few guidelines to consider when using color in data, guidelines which form a structured methodology for creating well-designed visualizations.</p>

<p>Color in data visualizations is either sequential, divergent, or qualitative. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Location + Divergent&nbsp; &ndash; In this map, divergent colors (orange and blue) are used to call out announced and modeled retirements. Unaffected plants are designated with a neutral shade of gray which causes those locations to recede into the background, second in visual hierarchy to the orange and blue circles which contrast starkly with one another and the map&rsquo;s background.</p>

<h2>Category +: Qualitative</h2>

<p>Common mistakes many people make when creating a data visualization is to 1). use too many colors, leading to visual clutter; and 2). use the wrong colors, leading to illegibility and ineffective communication. The general rule of thumb when choosing data visualization palettes is to choose no more than 2-3 hues, paired with variations in chroma and value to expand the palette.</p>

<h2>Time + sequential</h2>

<p>Sequential color palettes are well-suited to plotting values along a spectrum from high to low. In most cases with lighter, less saturated colors indicating lower values and darker or more saturated colors tied to higher ones. But in the elegant, beautiful example below, live wind speeds are mapped from slow (dark), to fast (white).</p>

<p>In this incredibly rich data visualization created for Nike by renowned computer scientist Ben Fry, both sequential and qualitative color palettes are used to map activity levels over time.</p>
