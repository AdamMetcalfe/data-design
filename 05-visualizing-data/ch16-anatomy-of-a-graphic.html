  <section data-type="sect1">

    <p>Once you’ve built a draft of your chart, the next step in creating an impactful visualization is making sure all of its elements are labeled appropriately. The text components of a graph give your reader visual clues that help you tell your data story, and should allow your graph to stand alone, outside of any supporting narrative.</p>

    <p>Let’s make sure a few terms are totally clear up front. When we’re talking about data labels, category labels, axis labels, and other pieces of text on your graph or chart, we’re generally referring to what is mapped out in Figure 1.</p>

    <figure>Figure 1 - Anatomy of a Graphic</figure>

    <p>We think one of the most impactful ways to show the value add of great text labels is by comparing two choices. Let’s take these two graphs showing the number of Olympic medals won by country at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014. </p>

    <figure>Figure 1 - Graph with stock labels</figure>

    <figure>Figure 2 - Graph well labeled.</figure>

    <p>Both graphs display the same data (and show how home team Russia ran away with the medal count!). The first has the default text generated by Excel, giving limited information to the reader, while the texted added in the second show how smart use of simple text can help tell your data story.</p>

    <p>In Figure 2, the simple addition of different text clues helps the reader understand what s/he is reading. Check out the the chart title, axis labels, the legend, and data labels. Each of these pieces of information is an opportunity to help your reader understand the message you want to share with your graph. </p>

    <p>As important as this text can be to help you tell your story, it uses prime real estate and should be as simple and direct as possible. Over-labeling axes or data points, or writing excessively long chart titles, is a quick way to clutter your visualization and reduce its impact. Graphs that pack a punch are often elegant in their simplicity. When you’re working on your graph or chart, don’t be afraid to experiment! It’s one of the great joys of the electronic tools we have for developing graphs and charts - changes can be made with the click of a button and a few keystrokes. Try adding different labels, editing them, and then taking them away as needed until you find the right mix that effectively communicates your message..</p>

    <p>In most cases, you want a chart or graph to be able to stand alone, outside of any narrative text. Sometimes, that means tacking on explanatory text to clearly articulate your message. This could be written as a caption above or beneath the graph to clearly articulate your message to a specific audience. For the sake of simplicity and addressing the essential, we’ll focus here on the essential labels and legends within your graph, rather than crafting additional explanations.</p>

    <h2>Clear and Relevant Axes</h2>

    <p>Let’s be clear about a couple of terms up front so there’s no confusion about how we’re using them: category labels are the ticks and categories along the axis that identify the data itself. Axis titles are the short text titles included along an axis to identify what variable is being displayed. Refer back to Figure 1 for a quick reference if you need to!</p>

    <p>You should use axis titles to give your reader a summary description of the variable you’re displaying. Depending on the data you’re working with, you may have extremely long and descriptive names for each of your variables (if someone built your data table and added lots qualifiying information), or very short, abbreviated variable names (as is often the case with machine-readable data).  What you write along your horizontal and vertical axes should start the axis title and be followed by the units you’re using to display information (percent, dollars, etc.). The axis titles remind your reader what information you’re sharing with them and help limit confusion about the units.</p>

    <p>Labeling your axes and categories It’s important to find a balance between giving enough information to your audience and keeping your text simple. Make sure you include enough information to explain the date you’re presenting, while keeping the text simple enough so it doesn’t clutter the graph. </p>

    <p>In our Olympic medal example, the x-axis shows the number of medals won at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter games. When creating a graph, it’s common to go through a couple of iterations of the axis labels and chart titles.  Once you’ve picked an axis title, think about how your reader could interpret that information.  An axis title of “Medals” seems straightforward enough, but what does exactly do we mean? Medals won? Medals lost? Medals won in 2014 alone? Medals won in any winter Olympic games? Your chart title can help clarify these questions, and your axis title also gives you the opportunity to tell your story.</p>

    <p>Instead of Medals, let’s title the x-axis with “Total Olympic Medals Won (2014).” Using the word “total” ensures the reader knows you’re talking about all medals, not only one kind (gold, silver, or bronze) or one event. “Olympic” ensures your reader knows that you’ve shared only the Olympic medals, not a total of Olympic and Paralympic medals for the same year. And finally, “2014” reminds your reader in what year the medals were won. Alternately, as we’ve shown here, you can include some of those details in the chart title, which we’ll talk about later in this chapter.</p>

    <p>Units When we refer to units, we’re talking about things like “percent”, “dollars”, “millions”, or other descriptors that  make sure your reader knows what kind of information you’re displaying. These are very important if you’re sharing data that are in percents instead of counts or if a multiplier has been used (for example, millions of dollars instead of just dollars).</p>

    <p>It’s important to be clear in labeling your units. Some quick checks to walk through when you’re assessing your axis titles:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Make sure you’re consistent if you’re displaying multiple types of data using a dual axis graph - you don’t want to display two variables with one in months and a second in years on the same axis! </li>
      <li>Instead of using abbreviations or acronyms, write out the full unit (for example, millimeters instead of mm). </li>
      <li>Common, universal symbols can be a helpful alternative to words in text ($ instead of dollar), but be cautious about who your audience is when using these symbols. Be explicit. A dollar could be currency in a myriad of different countries, not just the US; if you mean US dollar, say US$ or US dollar, unless you’re certain that it’s understood to be that particular national currency.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are occasions where, for the sake of visual simplicity, you can get away with omitting the axis title if the categories of information you’re sharing are self explanatory. In our Olympic medal graph, we’ve listed the country names across the y-axis. If you’re confident your audience will be able to recognize that the fields listed are countries, there’s no need to over complicate the graph by adding an axis title that says, “Country.” If you have any doubt about your audience’s knowledge of your categories, err on the side of caution and label your axes though.</p>

    <p>Position and format Axis titles should be aligned in parallel to each axis. Format them in a font size large enough to read, but not so large that it dominates the graph.</p>

    <p>Individual category labels should be clearly marked too. Make sure any words and numbers are easy to read: your reader should not have to play contortionist games with his/her neck to get a good look at what you’re trying to share in your graph. A few tricks to formatting your axis labels:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Where possible, avoid rotating text on an angle, which is often used in vertical bar charts to force long text labels to fit but is difficult to read. If you find yourself with an x-axis with rotated, dense labels, try changing your chart type to a horizontal bar, which will make the labels easier to read.</li>
      <li>Simplify your labels. Even if your data is originally formatted with long strings of text for each category you’re trying to display, think about what you can simplify without losing meaning.</li>
      <li>Use boldface text and italics sparingly and only where they have meaning. For example, you might use boldface for a category label (again, in our example highlighting the US medal count) for a data point you’re highlighting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Labeling Your Data</h3>

    <p>To label or not to label: that is the question.  A data label is most commonly added as the data value associated with a bar or point on a graph. When you want to make sure your audience has access to the precise data points, adding data labels works well. What labels to add, if any, depend on your audience and the story you’re trying to tell with your chart or graph. Labels can add detail and value to your visualization, but can just as easily clutter it and confuse your reader.</p>

    <p>You don’t have to limit your data labels to the data values themselves, though the numeric values are the most common ones added. Instead, you can label the bars/dots/etc. to highlight specific pieces of information with a text description where appropriate. For example, if you’re creating a complex chart that shows the number of Olympic medals won by a country over the past 50 years, for example, you may want to label the year with the highest total as “most medals” to help it jump out for the reader for its value (and not just the raw number).</p>

    <p>When deciding how you can use data labels to create impact, think about your audience. Do they need to know the precise numbers you’re displaying on your chart? Are you trying to show a trend? Are you using a graph to help your audience easily see highs and lows? Depending on what information your audience needs, you could choose one of three approaches towards labels.</p>

    <h3>Option 1: Label every point</h3>

    <figure>Figure 3 - Olympic chart with every bar labeled</figure>

    <p>Data labels for every point ensure your reader can easily read the precise value of each data point. Color and position are important to consider when adding all of these values to the graph. For bar charts or pie charts, placing the labels inside the bars can help make the graph or chart look more elegant, as you can see in Figure 3.</p>

    <p>Labeling each point can provide detailed information, but also make your graph look messy when you have a large number of fields. Scatterplots are a great example of a graph type that typically looks messy with all data points labeled, particularly if the labels are text (country names) like in Figure 4. So many labels! So much overlap! So...hard to read.</p>

    <figure>Figure 4 - Scatterplot with a sea of data labels</figure>

    <p>Determine if your reader really needs to know each precise value, or if you’re trying to show trends, highs, or lows, in which case, move onto Option 2.</p>

    <h3>Option 2: Label the data points you want to highlight</h3>

    <p>When you’re trying to emphasize how specific data points compare to others (for example, highlighting the data from one country across many in the same region) or emphasizing the high and low values, having selective data labels can guide your reader. Here are two examples for different audiences. </p>

    <figure>Figure 4 - Olympic chart with highest and lowest bars labeled</figure>

    <p>If your audience is interested in the range of values for number of medals won by the top ten countries, label the high and low values. By highlighting the highest and lowest values, you establish the range of the values. Additional formatting the choices, like making the high and low bars different colors, also call out these values.</p>

    <figure>Figure 5 - Olympic chart with United States labeled</figure>

    <p>If your audience is from one specific country and wants to see how their medal wins compare to the other top ten countries’ medal totals, highlight and provide the data point for the single county (for example, the United States).</p>

    <h3>Option 3: No data labels </h3>

    <figure>See Figure 3 (no data labels)</figure>

    <p>We often build graphs to simplify the visual presentation of information. If you can effectively convey your message without complicating your visual with extra labels and text, just say no to adding data labels. Reserve the use of labels for the occasions when you need that level of detail: make your default to be no labels and then add as needed.</p>

    <p>Disclaimer on pie charts and data labels: If you are compelled or required to use a pie chart to show information, never display more than three kinds of information and don’t expect your reader to compare area across multiple pie charts. Because the values associated with different slices of pie charts can be tough for the human eye to assess, it’s often best to add data labels to add clarity. But, as we said, best to avoid pie charts when possible.  There is (almost) always a better kind of visualization to use instead of a pie chart. </p>

    <h2>Simple and Powerful Legends</h2>

    <p>A legend ensures that your reader knows what your graph’s colors or patterns mean. When you’re only showing one kind of data where color or pattern doesn’t carry any special meaning, you don’t need a legend (as in the earlier bar charts, only showing total medal count). If you have multiple kinds of data represented on your graph or chart, a legend is essential.</p>

    <p>Say that instead of showing total medal count, you want to show the total count broken down by medal types (gold, silver, and bronze).  You could include them all one bar chart with a different color to represent each medal type.</p>

    <figure>Figure 6 - Olympic medal totals broken down by color</figure>

    <p>Here, each color represents a single medal type and is clearly defined in the legend on the top of the graph. Consider how your reader will look at your graph; obscuring the legend in a corner can make it difficult to find quickly, while laying it over white space on the chart (for example, where there are short bars) can be distracting.</p>

    <p>This graph is a great example of the importance of position for the legend. By aligning the legend along the top of the bar chart, it’s easy to visually place which color aligns with which data category. While the placement of the legend is partially an aesthetic choice, its placement can visually assist your reader in interpreting your graph.</p>

    <h2>Concise but Impactful Titles</h2>

    <p>At last! You’ve labeled your axes. You’ve added (or decided not to add) data labels. You’ve ensured that the categories or values along your axes are clear. Now, your opportunity to tell your data story in 1-2 lines of text: your chart title. The title should succinctly tell your reader what message this graph or chart has been designed to convey. It doesn’t have to be a complete sentence, but it should be free of complicated language and syntax.</p>

    <p>It’s important to think about who your audience is and where your graph is going to be published when writing your chart title: are you a journalist adding the chart to an article, a blogger creating a very visual post, or perhaps a scientist going for a peer reviewed publication? Scientists may need to clearly articulate the relationship displayed between their variables, while a journalist may want to give some spin to the title to emphasize the message they want to share with the graph or chart.</p>

    <p>The most basic graph titles clearly state the relationship between the independent variable on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis. For example, we called our medal count graph, “Top Ten Countries by Medal Count, Sochi Winter Olympics 2014.” This title tells that reader that we’re looking at the total medals won (medal count) by country, limited to the top ten winners at the Sochi Winter Olympic Games in 2014.  Each element of the chart title we’ve created adds value and tells something to the reader. There’s nothing wrong with titles like these - while somewhat dry, they’re straightforward and clearly tell your reader what is on the graph.</p>

    <p>You can also approach a title as an opportunity to state the conclusion your reader should draw from your graph. For example, in our example where we highlighted the US medal count, if you want to highlight the US ranking second in overall medal count, you could title the graph, “US ranks second for total medals won, Sochi Winter Olympics 2014.” Often you seen these leading titles in newspapers and other publications telling a specific story. The chart title provides an extra opportunity to emphasize and amplify your message - use it!</p>

    <p>Looking for feedback One of the best ways to see if your chart or graph clearly communicates your message is to ask an impartial party to take a look - this is the time to call in that favor and ask a friend or colleague for five minutes and some honest feedback. Ask your reviewer to take a look at your chart and identify if there’s any information they feel is missing. Remember not to take it personally if there are edits that need to happen; the best charts and graphs happen through multiple drafts and with the help of collaborators. </p>

    <p>This final check is a great way to make sure you’ve provided enough detail in your axis labels, axis titles, chart title, and legend. If some thoughtful changes are suggested, go back to the file and make a few edits: it will be time well spent, and at the end of the day your visualization will be better for it!</p>
