<h2>Form (Frequently) Tyrannizes Function</h2>

<p>Listening to someone with a good voice sing a few bars of &ldquo;I Want to Hold Your Hand&rdquo; pretty much beats out the experience of hearing someone mutter &ldquo;E=MC2&rdquo; any day, but that doesn&rsquo;t tell us much about the value of what&rsquo;s in the words. What it does tell us is that the experience of information often dominates the perception of its value.</p>

<p>Many of us in the domain of data visualization often wince at the idea that our discipline has its roots in the larger, messier, more primeval world of art, design, narrative and performance. We imagine data visualization to live on the outskirts of that leafy college town known as Science, if not living right in the middle of it, on Objective Boulevard. But the fact is, at its heart data visualization is a form of illustration and storytelling, while at its heart science is not. And no story is ever told from an objective point of view. The graphical representation of data has been used as effectively by scientists reporting groundbreaking research as it has by dictators and terrorists justifying acts of violence. To that point, a critical rule in data visualization is that you must first and foremost be cognizant that you&rsquo;re creating, at some level, a biased point of view &mdash; if you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll have little chance of successfully judging the honesty, accuracy, elegance or utility of your solution. Even the most &ldquo;typical&rdquo; chart should embrace its roots, and seek to captivate and inspire that part of human minds that yearns for symmetry, meaning and narrative while in the act of seeking information. In other words, we are singers, not murmurers. And no, that doesn&rsquo;t mean change everything to make it pretty. It means you must, first and foremost, acknowledge that you are not presenting information, you are designing an experience of information.</p>

<p>No doubt there is a researcher reading this who wants to say: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making a graph to show how many times a rat turned left or right in a maze. Why does a graph that displays that information necessarily reflect a bias or a narrative perspective?&rdquo; The answer is that though the data shows the rat turned left 35 times and right 22 times, the way the visualization of that data is designed will &ndash; usually within one or two seconds &ndash; teach the viewer what is important and what is not. Being cognizant of that fact in the process of design makes your graphical representations of data much more effective, and puts you in a better position to be master the craft, and carefully plan and think through what you want to express before, and while, you design.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll look at some of the most critical elements of design in data visualization and how they can be used to sway, focus, clarify, enhance and sharpen the audience&rsquo;s perception of the data. To that end, let&rsquo;s look at three of the most important tools available: fonts, color and icons.</p>

<h2>Fonts &amp; Text</h2>

<h3>Legibility and Readability</h3>

<p>Critical to the design of the experience of information is the manner in which that information is delivered. In data visualization, that usually means a mixture of graphical and textual presentation. Core to the choices you make in presenting the data, and probably the most important rule of all is strive for ruthless simplicity in every choice you make. In the &ldquo;narrative&rdquo; of the information you are presenting, the style of presentation should never make itself central. This is most clearly true when selecting fonts.</p>

<p>In the world of typography, the balance between between <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#legibility">legibility</a> and <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#readability">readability</a> is a decision that a font designer makes when designing a font. Not all fonts that are legible (e.g., you can easily tell one character from another) are necessarily readable (e.g., the font is &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; &ndash; you can read without the font taking center stage and being noticed by the reader, and is designed in such a way to support and enhance reading). There are many fonts that are designed specifically to stand out. For example:</p>

<figure><img alt="Display fonts" src="../images/sections/05/crazy-fonts.png" /></figure>

<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that you should not use these sorts of &ldquo;ornamental&rdquo; fonts in data visualization because they create additional work for the reader. You can&rsquo;t afford your viewer straying for a second, or even half a second, trying to understand what something says. These fonts are very good examples of fonts that are legible, but not readable. This is one example of how data visualization and storytelling are similar: if your audience becomes too aware of the style of how a story is told, they will never be able to clearly judge the meaning, or level of valuable detail, in the content. In that respect, you must always use fonts that are legible and strive to present them in a readable fashion. The examples above are fonts that, first and foremost, are about Design with a capital &ldquo;d&rdquo; &mdash; they are not about the utility of conveying information quickly and transparently.</p>

<p>Fonts for data visualization should primarily stick to those that convey information without calling attention to themselves. Some examples are: Helvetica, Arial, and Gill Sans. In general, it&rsquo;s best to use san serif fonts for numbers in charts of any sort because serif fonts tend to create more &ldquo;visual noise&rdquo; to be interpreted. For example:</p>

<figure><img alt="Comparison of ssan serif and serif fonts" src="../images/sections/05/sans-vs-serif.png" /></figure>

<p>Believe it or not, your mind takes a fraction of a second longer to understand the numbers on the right than it does to understand the numbers on the left. The reason is that serif fonts have stylistic variations in their endpoints, widths, curves and shapes that adds more for the eye to take in at any given moment.</p>

<figure><img alt="Highlight serif font" src="../images/sections/05/serif.png" /></figure>

<p>Since data visualization seeks to speed the process of insight, you want to stay away from anything that slows down the viewer&rsquo;s understanding, even by a fraction of a second.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;Omit Needless Words&rdquo;</h3>

<p>In &ldquo;The Elements of Style,&rdquo; the famous style guide for American English, the authors (E. B. White and William Strunk Jr.) propose what they consider to be one of the most important rules a writer must keep in mind: &ldquo;Omit needless words&rdquo;. This same rule should be followed by all practitioners of data visualization.</p>

<h2>Color</h2>

<h3>Conceive in Black and White, Then Add Color</h3>

<p>To paraphrase the designer Paul Rand, if a design doesn&rsquo;t make sense in black and white it will make less sense when color is added. That&rsquo;s not meant to imply that graphical representations of data should always be black and white. It only means that balance of line and solid, dark and light, layout and structure are what&rsquo;s most critical to creating a chart or visualization that clearly conveys its value. The assumption is that you are making visualizations because you want to provide clarity, insight and context. Color is a tool, but it should never be the starting point. The rule should be: conceive and plan your charts and visualizations in black and white whenever possible, then carefully assess how color should be used. Then, apply color very conservatively, with the primary objective of highlighting and enhancing comprehension. Here are three basic tips to keep in mind when assessing how to use color in graphical representations of data.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t Forget Gray</h3>

<p>Gray is one of the most important colors in your palette because it offsets and clarifies the colors around it. In the world of information design, it is critical for modifying, clarifying and balancing almost any palette, and taming the overall graphical comprehension of charts.</p>

<figure><img alt="Simple color palette" src="../images/sections/05/simple-palette.png" /></figure>

<h3>Colors Can Be Used to Express Value</h3>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that color can be used as a more conceptual axis that designates values within a visualization. That being said, it&rsquo;s important to remember, when using colors to represent a scale, or gradations of value of any sort, that you look at what you&rsquo;ve created with all the color/saturation removed. This helps guarantee that the tints you are using correlate to truly different values.</p>

<figure><img alt="Comparison of color graph and grayscale version" src="../images/sections/05/grayscale-and-color.png" /></figure>

<h3>Color&rsquo;s Effectiveness is Determined by White Space</h3>

<p>If you were painting, you could merge colors in one seamless quilt. But in information design, every color you use must have a reason for being there, and should be distinct. If you are creating a chart in which a very slow gradation or change from one color to another has meaning, as it might if representing climate data, election turnouts, etc., then the changing and merging of colors in the depiction is central to interpreting the data. But for the most part colors need to be distinct, since they will represent a value or attribute, and in order to be distinct and clear to the viewer, they must be given room to breathe.</p>

<h2>Icons</h2>

<h3>A Short History</h3>

<p>The first <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#interface-user-graphical">graphical user interface</a> (GUI) was introduced by Xerox in 1981 in the Star workstation, also called the 8010 Information System, but the ideas that inspired it were first explored by one of its chief designers, David Canfield Smith, in his 1975 PhD thesis titled, Pygmalion: A Creative Programming Environment. A couple years later, Steve Jobs famously &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; the idea from Smith and Xerox for the Macintosh, and outward into the lives of everyday people it went. Only a few decades later, two thirds of the seven billion people on Earth use mobile phones that are largely driven by graphical, icon-based interfaces.</p>

<p>Future historians of science will no doubt pinpoint the invention of the GUI as a critical turning point in the evolution of human-computer interaction, but simply drawn, easy to remember pictograms have been used since neolithic times to represent information that was too complex to explain in a small amount of space. Within the practice of data visualization itself, iconography has been used as far back as the early 15th century, borrowing things from other disciplines that sought precision and accuracy in drawings: architecture, military planning, cartography, alchemy and astronomy.</p>

<h3>Use Skepticism and Lean Toward the Literal</h3>

<p>The use of icons is now so widespread and commonplace that they are often added without much thought. People feel they should &ldquo;just be there&rdquo; in order for an app to feel like an app or a website to feel user friendly. As a result, we often see them without ever wondering why they were put there in the first place, kind of the way we &ldquo;notice&rdquo; hubcaps on a car. They&rsquo;d be more noticeable if they weren&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p>This is precisely why, when creating graphical representations of data, you should regard the use of icons with caution. The rule should be: if you can make something clear in a small space without using an icon, don&rsquo;t use an icon. Why? Because quite often icons make things more obscure, not less. As soon as anyone asks, &ldquo;What does this icon mean?&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve lost the battle to make things ruthlessly simple. This is true for icons that are used as metaphorical identifiers in <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#infographic">infographics</a> or data visualizations, as well as for functional icons that perform a task, or reveal more information within the context of an interactive graph or infographic.</p>

<p>Although the following example is a very simple infographic, it illustrates issues that hold true even in the most complex interactive data visualizations.</p>

<figure><img alt="Pictogram for temperature preference" src="../images/sections/05/temperature-preference-many.png" /></figure>

<p>It would be very hard to misunderstand what the icons are meant to represent here: one person-shaped icon = one person. This is a very literal representation, and that is why it is so easily understood. In fact, the more literal and simple an icon is, the better it is. It is a very similar issue to the one faced when selecting fonts &ndash; if the user/viewer spends too much time adjusting their minds to an elaborate presentation, they will often miss the full value and substance of what is actually being presented. Here is another version of the same information:</p>

<figure><img alt="Single icon pictogram for temperature preference" src="../images/sections/05/temperature-preference-single.png" /></figure>

<p>The exact same data is being conveyed here, but it takes the viewer slightly longer to understand it. Why? The viewer is asked to create a complex metaphor in their head. First, they&rsquo;re being asked to imagine that this icon represents all twenty test subjects, but they're then also being asked to divide that metaphorical person in their mind by another set of criteria. As simple as they may seem, icons are still asking the mind to pretend they represent something else. The more you ask symbols to represent, the less literal and less clear they become. When it comes to using symbols and icons of any sort, they must stick to one simple meaning each.</p>

<h3>Stay Cognizant of Future Needs</h3>

<p>It is not uncommon for new traders to join an investment bank and have someone walk them through the company&rsquo;s software on the trading floor, with the assurance: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll understand what all the icons mean after you&rsquo;ve been here a few weeks&rdquo;. A mass proliferation of icons across an interface or data visualization often indicates that options have been added after the overall planning, design and (in the circumstances of interactive data visualization) development has taken place.</p>

<p>Here is a simplified example of the sort of icon-based fold-out palette one frequently finds in financial analysis dashboards that have gone through several versions in which capabilities have been added over time:</p>

<figure><img alt="Icon dashboard" src="../images/sections/05/dashboard.png" /></figure>

<p>One of the greatest challenges in the graphical representation of data is how to ruthlessly simplify even while the complexity of choice for the viewer or user increases. As in the example above, sometimes icons are used to solve this problem; but as you can see, this can create another problem: confusion.</p>

<p>The best way to avoid this is take time during the initial conceptual work on any given data visualization to assess what the extreme requirements might be in future iterations. As yourself: what options or views might be added in the future? Or, in the circumstance of complex interactive data views, what possible functionality might be introduced that would change the nature of the overall visualization?</p>

<p>These are just a few of the core guidelines for employing icons in infographics or complex data visualizations, but they are the most important.</p>
