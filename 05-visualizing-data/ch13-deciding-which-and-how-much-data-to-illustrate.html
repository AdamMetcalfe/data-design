<h1>Deciding Which and How Much Data to Illustrate</h1>
</header>

<section data-type="sect1">
<p>Let&rsquo;s lay some groundwork for successful data presentation. If done thoughtfully, it will go a long way in helping you determine which aspects of your data to visualize and how. We&rsquo;ll begin with a little brainstorming. You can do this in just a few thoughtful moments, over a few hours, alone, or working as a team. Your work here is two-fold; define your message, define your intended audience. You can flip this sequence around, but we&rsquo;ll begin with defining your message.</p>

<h2>Determine your message</h2>

<p>Before tackling which data to present, take a few minutes to decide what you have to say. Close down your latest social media craze, step back from your computer, and consider the exact message you want to communicate. Ask yourself, &ldquo;What do I know, what does it means, and why do I believe it&rsquo;s important?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Consider a data set containing observations on different types of caffeine and the effects of consumption. Don&rsquo;t stop at &ldquo;caffeine affects the body.&rdquo; You never want to present information that solicits a &ldquo;well, duh&rdquo; response. Dig deeper. Be more specific. What does your data say about how caffeine effects the body? Are the effects all good, all bad, maybe an interesting combination of both? Do the effects change with a person&rsquo;s age and/or sex? Are some caffeinated beverages better or worse for over-all health? Your answer should be concise-- short, sweet, and to the point. A statement such as &ldquo;Coffee has an ability to reduce the risk of certain diseases and ailments, when consumed in moderation, because it contains key antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and dietary proteins,&rdquo; goes a lot further then our original example. Even better, it establishes a pretty clear focus for our visuals, and some common language to use with our audience.</p>

<p>Right about now you should be having a flashback to English 101. That&rsquo;s because determining your key message is just like writing a good thesis statement. If you can&rsquo;t summarize your key message in a few concise sentences you probably need a better grasp of the topic. Sound harsh? Maybe, but not as harsh as presenting information to a crowd of your yawning disinterested peers. Fight the urge to skip this step! If you&rsquo;re the paper-and-pencil type, go ahead and write your message down! You can use it as a reference throughout your <a class="glossterm" target="_blank" href="glossary01.html#visualization-data">data visualization process</a>.</p>

<p>Your chances of creating a compelling, well-organized visual argument is greater if you begin with a clear and focused message.</p>

<h2> Understand your audience</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve determined your message. Let&rsquo;s now consider the importance of understanding your audience. This knowledge will go just as far in helping you determine which and how much data to illustrate.</p>

<p>Take another couple of minutes and ask yourself &ldquo;what information is most valuable to my audience&rdquo;, &ldquo;what role will my visuals play in this dialogue&rdquo;, and &ldquo;what action(s) should do I want to incite?&rdquo; Would you spend time explain algebra to a group of Engineers? The correct answer is no. What would be the point? The better you know your audience, the better your chances of creating a successful visual presentation.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine presenting data on &ldquo;Environmental Conservation in the New Millennium&rdquo; in the following scenarios: (1) on a small-scale blog visited mostly by lay environmentalist, (2) in a classroom of high school students, and (3) at a fundraising event for an environmental conservation organization. Would you create and explain your data the same way to each audience? Hopefully not. You should be able to make a few assumptions about what&rsquo;s most relevant to present even if you&rsquo;ve never met a single audience member.</p>

<p>In our blog scenario, we can assume visitors are already interested in conservation. They may have spent time doing actual research. A portion are return visitors who may rely on your specific perspective; they might see you as a content area expert. Your site is, most likely, not the only blog on which they rely, but one day it could be their favorite! At minimum, we can assume they&rsquo;ve stumbled upon your blog intentionally, and not because of issues with autocomplete. In this instance breadth and depth are key. You can take more time to explore, deconstruct and restructure facts. If the intention of your site is to incite further exploration, you can presents visuals that pose questions or make viewers questions their own beliefs.</p>

<p>Our high school student scenario is a bit different. You can assume an audience possessing novice-level familiarity with the topic of conversation. As always, some members will know more than others. Attendance may be mandatory, not voluntary; keeping their interest will be key. You&rsquo;ll want to present fascinating, high-level, attention-grabbing visuals, because they have more pressing issues to ponder. Semantics, you&rsquo;ll want to approach with care; explaining less-common terminology, and including more visual indicators of good/bad, positive/negative. Your visual display-- intended to clearly present the importance of conservation, leaving little room for doubt.</p>

<p>Still yet, we have our fundraiser attendees. This audience needs to feel that environmental conservation is cause worthy of their monetary support. It will likely be a mixed crowd -- interested donors, their disinterested partners (who just came for free food and drinks), field experts, employees, and interns. You can assume they&rsquo;ll expect emotion-driven visuals that balance sentimentality with dire need, because parting with money is, after all, an emotional task. We&rsquo;ve assumed the crowd is mixed, so you&rsquo;ll want to use language that is both familiar and easily understood without coming of as condescending. This audience expects to have their interests in the importance of conservation confirmed. Your visuals should accommodate. As with your student group, leave no obvious question unanswered.</p>

<div data-type="warning"><p>Presenting emotion-driven content doesn't mean leaving out key facts if they don't fit into your ideal storyline. Be extra careful when sharing cause-driven content, and do your best to ensure that your values don't interfere with accurate presentation of the data!</p></div>

<p>Below are example visuals presenting &ldquo;Environmental Conservation in the New Millennium&rdquo;, one for each audience. You can see how each visual has been tailored to its audience based on the assumptions we&rsquo;ve made above (below?). Sure, you can swap these around. But doing so dilutes the message, and has the potential to communicate something unintended.</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve discussed the importance of determining a key message and understanding its audience, let&rsquo;s delve into deciding which data to illustrate.</p>

<h2>Deciding Which Data to Illustrate</h2>

<p>You can begin the process of deciding which data to illustrate by expanding your key message into a narrative, or story. Our goal is to present a sequence or set of facts, which gradually lead your audience to the key message. Your determination of which facts to illustrate is the same as determining the most important events of a story. The data you choose to illustrate should set context, establish the main variables, and explain how these variables are connected. Be intentional but do not censor. Your visual story should be based on what the data says, not what you want to say.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the following table presenting nicotine sales in a small European country. We&rsquo;ll use it to create visuals supporting a message about health. In each instance, we&rsquo;ll assume our audience has some knowledge about the issue.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Year</th>
			<th>Cigarette Sales (in millions)</th>
			<th>eCigarette Sales (in millions)</th>

			<td>2013</td>
			<td>20.0</td>

</table>

<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss two possible narratives that you could create from this data set: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Healthier Than Ever! Cigarette Sales Reach 10-Year Low,&rdquo; and &ldquo;2010 Smoking Ban Pushes New Users to Electronic Cigarettes and Improved Health&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>We&rsquo;re Healthier Than Ever! Cigarette Sales Reach 10-Year Low</h3>

<p>We can create a story from the first message by focusing solely on the fact that cigarette sales in 2004 were higher than in 2014. Assuming our audience believes in the negative affects of smoking we can easily conclude that less sales mean less smoking and a healthier society. Our story would begin by looking at sales in 2004, and charting how they begin to decrease over the ten-year period. It would end with 2014 and the $10M sales decrease. This story would have to exclude related variables, such as market size and sales tax.</p>

<h3>2010 Smoking Ban Pushes New Users to Electronic Cigarettes and Improved Health</h3>

<p>For our second message, we&rsquo;ll take the entire data set into account. We&rsquo;ll make observations about various deviations in sales, and we&rsquo;ll explain how the different variables are connected. With a focus on the year 2010, during which an in-door smoking ban was enacted, we can including the facts that (1) cigarette sales began to decline, (2) there was a noticeable increase in the country&rsquo;s various nicotine sales taxes, and (3) cigarettes began to represent a smaller percentage of all nicotine sales, while the market share of electronic cigarettes grew. We could also look at the rate of increase and decline. Here, we could highlight electronic cigarette sales growing faster than the sales decline of regular cigarettes.</p>

<figure><img alt="Cigarette sales line graph" src="../images/sections/05/ecigarettes.png" /></figure>

<p>In both instances we&rsquo;ve assumed that our audience is aware of the ingredients in cigarettes. We also assume a commonly held belief that cigarettes are bad for your health because of these ingredients. Our first example is a clear exaggeration of what happens when you create a story based on what you want to say, and not what the data says. Unfortunately, data applications such as this are neither uncommon nor farfetched. We see this done on the news, and during casual conversations. The omission of key facts and related variables creates a visual that is full of misinformation. It lacks credibility, and presents obvious biases. The second instance presents far less outright bias, is a plausible story based on the data available, presents context, introduces all variables, and explains how the variables are connected. Despite some faults, both stories create a meaningful connection with the audience.</p>

<h2> Deciding How Much Data to Illustrate</h2>

<p>In previous sections we&rsquo;ve gone over how to determined a key message, the importance of identifying the audience, and a process for isolating facts to illustrate. We can proceed to determining how much of our data we need to visualize.</p>

<p>If illustrating data is supposed to make information more digestible, then care should be taken not to present more than the audience expects, or more than they need to understand your message. As you decide how much data to illustrate, keep in mind the idea that more is not always synonymous with better, unless it&rsquo;s meaningful and presented in support of your key message. In most instances, your visuals will be encountered as part of a narrative, contents in a storehouse, or maybe a combination of both.</p>

<p>As previously discussed, a narrative is a simply a story presenting a sequence or set of facts, which gradually lead your audience to the key message. When you think of the narrative, think of written reports, Power Point presentations, and individual articles in newspapers, magazines, and online. You want to illustrate just enough data for your audience to easily identify and understand your perspective without becoming exhausted. Each data illustration should hold a specific intention. Avoid including visuals simply because they impress. As a test, try removing one or more illustrations, or rearranging the presentation order. Does your narrative still make sense? Each illustration should stand alone, without too much verbal or written explanation, but if it doesn&rsquo;t add to the audiences understanding, it&rsquo;s probably not needed.</p>

<p>For the narrative audience members wanting more, you can always provide links or references to additional graphical takes on your data, along with detailed commentary to contextualize and further explain the information. If you&rsquo;d like to impress a technically savvy audience, a graphical appendix could be even be shared as a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository or a gallery of code gists hosted on <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/" target="_blank">bl.ocks.org</a>.</p>

<p>A storehouse can be thought of as an information repository. Usually consisting up of multiple narratives and stand-alone content, this is an example of when more can be better. Unlike those of a narrative, storehouse visitors are less susceptible to data fatigue. They respond well to large quantities of data because they expect to spend time building or enhancing their understanding of a topic. The storehouse doesn&rsquo;t need to focus on presenting a single message. Its audience seeks new treatments of data, a diversity of perspectives, and various dissections of topic or content area. In the storehouse scenario, the main factor for deciding how much data to illustration should focus on avoiding redundancy. If you illustration fails to add something new to the mix, or expand on a topic, it can be omitted.</p>

<p>To exemplify, lets imagine a cinephile and store manager. Both are browsing a blog filled with upcoming movie release dates, reviews, and critiques of directors. The cinephile spends hours on the site, soaking up each and every visual and reading through its content. The manager simply wants to know what popular movies they should order for the next holiday season. The manager probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to spend hours trying to find his answer. For our cinephile, more is better; for the manager, less if more.</p>

<h2>Editing and Revising</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a frequent and frustrating occurrence: you did your brainstorming, made a bunch of visualizations, and edited down to the best subset to include in your project. You were careful not to overwhelm your audience, and you made sure that your illustrations covered the most important key points without being redundant.</p>

<p>How maddening, then, to field questions (in a presentation), or see comments (in a story or blog post), calling for the very visualizations that you left on the cutting room floor! You second-guess your calls, resist the urge to argue with the person asking the question, grit your teeth and grumble. (&ldquo;I did that one!&rdquo; you mutter to yourself.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s okay. If you do a good job and engage your audience, they will naturally be curious and want more information. They might want to see the same data presented in a different way, to dig down, or to zoom out. If these questions mirror the decisions you were making in your selection process, that&rsquo;s good news! It means you are on the same wavelength as your audience, and that they are involved and interested in your data story.</p>

<p>There are several ways to keep (but de-emphasize) the visualizations that did not make the cut in your main collection. For slideshows, it is common practice to have a collection of extra slides after the &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;/ ending slide that contain information that might be interesting but that won&rsquo;t fit within the time limit. &ldquo;Yes, I do have that broken down by [industry sector/year/country/gender],&rdquo; you say confidently as you flip to the prepared slide. Voila!</p>

<p>Another way to do this would be to publish interactive versions of your visualizations that allow the viewers to dive in and explore the information themselves. If you're able to share the raw data sets, that's even better! That way, those who wish to dig deeper and understand the data in new ways will have the option to do so. We'll talk more about static and interactive graphics later in the <em><a href="ch19.html">Print vs. Web, Static vs. Interactive</a></em> chapter.</p>
