<h1>Choosing a graph type</h1>

<h1><font color="#333333" face="Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 25.5px;">Once you've figured out which and how much data you want to visualize, you need to figure out what type of graph you want to use to tell your story. &nbsp;There are only certain graph types that will make sense for your data and, of those, some will help illustrate your point better than other.</span></font></h1>

<p>There are a few important questions to ask yourself when you're trying to decide what type of graph to use.</p>

<p>*How many variables are you trying to graph?</p>

<p>Some types of charts and graphs lend themselves to simplicity and work best when you're only working with one or two variables. &nbsp;Pie charts, basic bar graphs, and histograms fall into this group. &nbsp;If you have multiple variables that you are trying to show, you will usually do better with a more complex graph type, such as a line graph or a stacked bar graph. &nbsp;(This assumes, of course, that the variables you are attempting to visualize together make sense to have in a single graphic. &nbsp;Keep in mind that more complex is not always better, and sometimes the best choice is to decrease the amount of information that you are trying to display in one place.)</p>

<p>*Type of variables</p>

<p>Each kind of graph only works with specific data types. &nbsp;For instance, you use pie charts to show what percent of the total group falls into each of several categories, so it only makes sense to use them with categorical or discrete data. It doesn't make sense to use a pie chart to visualize a continuous variable, unless you break the continuous variable into categories first (see page XXX). {Insert pie charts} &nbsp;Conversely, a line graph is used to plot the value of one continuous variable against another continuous variable, like height by age or income by year. {Insert line graphs} If we have one continuous variable and another discrete variable, like countries per year, a bar graph is more appropriate than a line graph. {Insert bar graph}</p>
