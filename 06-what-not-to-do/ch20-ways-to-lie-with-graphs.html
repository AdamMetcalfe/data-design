  <blockquote>“With great power comes great responsibility.”</blockquote>

  <p>Although we could argue who should be credited with this phrase, we can all undoubtedly relate to it or any number of its variations. In the case of this book, we have given you incredible power and tools to use in building compelling stories through visualization. How that power is used is ultimately up to you, but be aware: misusing this power could unintentionally mislead audiences.</p>

  <p>In the following sections, we will explore ways that the brain operates and naturally desires to seek out discrepancies and define boundaries in our visual field. We will look at mechanisms that can fool our brains at a high-level as well as ways this can happen at a more granular scale.</p>

  <h2>Contrast</h2>

  <p>Our brains love a difference. They immediately seek to discriminate between background and foreground and to define boundaries of objects (e.g., where your coffee cup ends and the table begins). The detection of these boundaries is based on variations of light intensity and color; therefore, the higher the contrast between two adjacent objects, the more likely they are identified to be different.</p>

  <h2>Color</h2>

  <p>Since the difference in colors is a primary way that contrast is established, it is imperative that we use color to ensure we do not deceive the brain. In designing graphics, we can use color to focus the mind on a particular, desired object or on whole areas of our graphic.</p>

  <p>For example, if we wanted to emphasize (or de-emphasize) a certain trend within a multi-line graph, all we have to do is slightly adjust shading. As [Graphic 1] illustrates below, emphasis on specific trends easily detracts from the rest of the series where we anomalies in the data can hide.</p>

  <p>If our objective is to highlight a particular section of an infographic, we can adjust its background shading to stand out above other, less relevant sections. To our eyes, reds and yellows come to the foreground, while blues recede to the background. As a result, components shaded in blue could appear as less relevant, while the eye is focused on more prevalent components or graphics shaded in red.</p>

  <p>Similarly, we can use shading to group data elements that would otherwise appear discrete.</p>

  <h2>Shapes</h2>

  <p>Shapes — referring to pictograms in this case — are also incredibly important in helping the brain differentiate entities, although they work the opposite way that colors do. Our brains have a much harder time discerning shapes than they do colors. Designers often think that using pictograms is a useful or playful way to illustrate an idea or to make an attractive infographic.</p>

  <p>What happens, however, is that the designer is forced into a trade-off between too much and too little detail. If a designer wants to compare similarities or differences between schools and churches on a map they might want to add a lot of detail to the pictograms so that they are distinguishable. Unfortunately, the more detail is included, the busier a graphic becomes. If the designer takes the opposite approach, their pictograms may become indistinguishable [see Graphic 4] and could dupe the brain into mis-reading the information.</p>

  <h2>Consistency</h2>

  <p>So far, we have explored the highest levels of visual cues which can be distracting and are sometimes used to lie to readers. Moving forward, we will continue to work down a list of visual cues, which facilitate good judgement by our brains using a principle of consistency to compare information. The full list of cues, in order of lowest accuracy to highest can be seen in [Graphic 5] below.</p>

  <figure>GRAPHIC 5:</figure>

  <h2>Area</h2>

  <p>Our brains are notoriously bad at discerning values encoded in area graphs — particularly those seen as bubble charts or circle graphs. In order to make infographics stand out from basic visuals, designers have started to frequently use bubble charts to represent their data. Unfortunately, while these designs may be non-traditional, they can be misleading.</p>

  <p>In [Graphic 6] below, what percentage of data is represented by the dark orange circle compared to the light orange circle behind it? Half or nearly half?</p>

    <figure><img src="../images/sections/06/circle-comparison.png" alt="Circle comparison" /></figure>

  <p>Compare the same data in the bar graph [Graphic 7] below. It’s much easier to do so, and it becomes much easier to compare the values.</p>

    <figure><img src="../images/sections/06/bar-comparison.png" alt="Bar Comparison" /></figure>

  <h2>Alignment</h2>

  <p>Even illustrations that use the appropriate types of graphs can still be misleading when they don’t use the appropriate alignment. Without appropriate alignment in our illustrations, graphs can become void of reference points that are used for comparison. Graphic 8 below shows how misaligned bars don’t provide us with enough information to accurately compare one to another, even though the x-axis has labeled tick marks.</p>

    <figure><img src="../images/sections/06/alignment.png" alt="Alignment" /></figure>

  <h2>The Details: Units, Labels, Axes, and Scales</h2>

  <p>As we work our way down the list of visual cues, we find that graphics can easily lie to the reader by modifying the details of our graphics. By mixing the minute details in our graphics, consistency can be drastically reduced in our visualization, fooling readers’ minds into misunderstanding data. This might happen by simply cluttering units, labels, axes, and scales showing data in unintentional ways.</p>

  <figure>GRAPHIC 9</figure>

  <p>[Graphic 9] above uses multiple currencies, which hold different values without any other distortion. Although it may make sense to show budgets for different cities according to their domestic currencies, it does not allow for easy comparison. This data is distorted further by inconsistent labeling as well as inconsistent axes: the primary axis is represented in whole numbers while the secondary axis is represented in thousands. </p>

  <p>Finally, scale is incredibly important to consider for comparison. In the example above, we are looking at a sample set of (made up) data for the budget of two cities with radically different populations. Chicago has a population nearly twice the size of Vienna, yet the graphic would lead you to believe that their transportation budgets are similar. The actual data used for this graphic looks much different than represented above.</p>

  <h2>Transparency</h2>

  <p>If we’ve considered all the options above and are able to use simple designs, appropriate color schemes, and functional, accurate graphs, what remains that could possibly create deceitful graphics for our audience? In this case, it is important to remember that the data we show is just as important as the data we don’t.</p>

  <p>For the purpose of this discussion, we should assume that the author does not want to lie outright. Graphics can instead mislead if the author decides not to show portions of his data at all [see Graphic 10]. Without context, the stories that are told have no comparison and rarely hold any value. As Graphic 10 illustrates, we don’t know if this trendline is good, bad, or average.</p>

  <figure>GRAPHIC 10</figure>

  <p>Alternatively, audiences can be overwhelmed with too much data that the context becomes lost among all the information. In doing so, lies can merely take the shape of an overcomplicated truth, like [Graphic 11] shows below. Graphic 11 shows the same line we saw in Graphic 10, but it can be disguised among the many others.</p>
