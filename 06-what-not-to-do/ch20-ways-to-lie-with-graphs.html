<h1>Ways to Lie with Graphs</h1>

<blockquote>&acirc;With great power comes great responsibility.&acirc;</blockquote>

<p>Although we could argue who should be credited with this phrase, we can all undoubtedly relate to it or any number of its variations. In the case of this book, we have given you incredible power and tools to use in building compelling stories through visualization. How that power is used is ultimately up to you, but be aware: misusing this power could unintentionally mislead audiences.</p>

<p>In the following sections, we will explore ways that the brain operates and naturally desires to seek out discrepancies and define boundaries in our visual field. We will look at mechanisms that can fool our brains at a high-level as well as ways this can happen at a more granular scale.</p>

<h2>Contrast</h2>

<p>Our brains love a difference. They immediately seek to discriminate between background and foreground and to define boundaries of objects (e.g., where your coffee cup ends and the table begins). The detection of these boundaries is based on variations of light intensity and color; therefore, the higher the contrast between two adjacent objects, the more likely they are identified to be different<span class="footnote" contenteditable="false" data-type="footnote">Cairo, Alberto. The Functional Art. Peachpit Press: 2012.</span>.</p>

<h2>Color</h2>

<p>Since the difference in colors is a primary way that contrast is established, it is imperative that we use color to ensure we do not deceive the brain. In designing graphics, we can use color to focus the mind on a particular, desired object or on whole areas of our graphic.</p>

<p>For example, if we wanted to emphasize (or de-emphasize) a particular trend within a multi-line graph, all we have to do is adjust the shading. As shown in the example below, the trend in red is more prominent and detracts from the rest of the series where anomalies in the data can hide.</p>

<figure><img alt="Improper color emphasis" src="../images/sections/06/color-emphasis.png" /></figure>

<p>If our objective is to highlight a particular section of an infographic, we can adjust its background shading to stand out above other, less relevant sections. To our eyes, reds and yellows come to the foreground, while blues recede to the background<span contenteditable="false" data-type="footnote">Rockwell, Ken. The Secret: What Makes a Great Photo. 2013: http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/basics.htm. Accessed 1 March 2014.</span>. As a result, components shaded in blue could seem less relevant, while the eye is focused on more prominent components shaded in red.</p>

<p>Similarly, we can use shading to group data elements that would otherwise appear discrete.</p>

<h2>Shapes</h2>

<p>Shapes are also incredibly important in helping the brain differentiate entities, although they work the opposite way that colors do. Our brains have a much harder time discerning shapes than they do colors. Designers often think that using pictograms&mdash;simplified, pictorial symbols for words, phrases, or objects&mdash;is a useful or playful way to illustrate an idea or to make an attractive infographic.</p>

<p>What happens, however, is that the designer is forced into a trade-off between too much and too little detail. If a designer wants to compare similarities or differences between schools and churches on a map they might want to add a lot of detail to the pictograms so that they are distinguishable. Unfortunately, the more details included, the busier a graphic becomes. If the designer takes the opposite approach, their pictograms may become indistinguishable, as shown below. This can dupe the brain into mis-reading the information.</p>

<h2>Consistency</h2>

<p>So far, we have explored the highest levels of visual cues which can be distracting, and are sometimes used to lie, to readers. Moving forward, we will continue to work down a list of visual cues, which facilitate good judgement by our brains using a principle of consistency to compare information. Here, we can see a graphic representation of the full list of cues, in order of lowest accuracy to highest<span class="footnote " contenteditable="false" data-type="footnote">Cleveland, William S., McGill, Robert. &ldquo;Graphical Perception and Graphical Methods for Analyzing Scientific Data.&rdquo; Science. 1985.</span>:</p>

<h2>Area</h2>

<p>Our brains are notoriously bad at discerning values encoded in area graphs, particularly those seen as bubble charts or circle graphs. Designers have started to use bubble charts in their infographics to represent their data. Unfortunately, while these designs may be non-traditional and visually eye-catching, they can be misleading.</p>

<p>In the circle graph below, what percentage of data is represented by the light red circle compared to the dark red circle behind it? Half or nearly half?</p>

<figure><img alt="Circle comparison" src="../images/sections/06/circle-comparison.png" /></figure>

<p>Now look at the same data in the form of a bar graph:</p>

<figure><img alt="Bar Comparison" src="../images/sections/06/bar-comparison.png" /></figure>

<p>It's much easier to see the relationship between the light and dark reds. As a result, the reader can more easily compare the values represented by each bar.</p>

<h2>Alignment</h2>

<p>Even illustrations that use the appropriate types of graphs can still be misleading if they don't use appropriate alignment. Without appropriate alignment in our illustrations, graphs can become void of the reference points we use to make comparisons. The graph below shows how misaligned bars don&acirc;t provide us with enough information to compare one bar with another, even though the x-axis has labeled tick marks.</p>

<figure><img alt="Alignment" src="../images/sections/06/alignment.png" /></figure>

<h2>The Details: Units, Labels, Axes, and Scales</h2>

<p>As we work our way down the list of visual cues, we find that graphs can easily lie to the reader when particular details&mdash;units, labels, axes, and scales&mdash;are cluttered or inconsistent. By mixing minute details, designers can introduce inconsistencies across visualizations, which can fool readers into misunderstanding the data. The graph below illustrates how these details can mislead the reader.</p>

<figure><img alt="Different axis labels" src="../images/sections/06/differing-axes.png" /></figure>

<p>This graph uses multiple currencies, the euro and U.S. dollar, to depict city budgets. Although it may make sense use each city's domestic currency, this approach does not allow for easy comparison. This data is distorted further by inconsistent labeling as well as inconsistent axes: the primary axis is represented in whole numbers while the secondary axis is represented in thousands.</p>

<p>Finally, scale is incredibly important to consider for comparison. In the example above, we are looking at a sample set of (made up) data for the budget of two cities with radically different populations. Chicago has a population nearly twice the size of Vienna, yet the graphic would lead you to believe that their transportation budgets are similar. The actual data used for this graphic looks much different than represented above.</p>

   <tr><td>2013</td><td>$4,305,000.00</td><td>€2,152,500.00</td></tr>
  </table>


<h2>Transparency</h2>

<p>If we&acirc;ve considered all the options above and are able to use simple designs, appropriate color schemes, and functional, accurate graphs, what remains that could possibly create deceitful graphics for our audience? In this case, it is important to remember that the data we show is just as important as the data we don&acirc;t.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this discussion, we should assume that the designer does not want to lie outright. Graphics can still mislead the reader if the designer decides not to show portions of his data at all. Without context, the stories that are told have no comparison and rarely hold any value. For example, we don&acirc;t know if the trendline in this graphic is good, bad, or average:</p>

    <figure><img src="../images/sections/06/no-context.png" alt="Line without context" /></figure>

<p>Alternatively, audiences can be overwhelmed when so much data is depicted that the context becomes lost among all the information. In doing so, lies can merely take the shape of an overcomplicated truth, as shown below:</p>

    <figure><img src="../images/sections/06/with-context.png" alt="Line with context" /></figure>

<p>This graph shows the same trend line we saw in the prior depiction. In this example, however, the trend is disguised among the many others.</p>
