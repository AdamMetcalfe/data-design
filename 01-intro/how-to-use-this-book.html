<h1>How to Use This Book</h1>

<h2>Structure of the Book</h2>

<p>The book&rsquo;s chapters follow pretty closely the actual set of steps that need to be accomplished before data can be visualized, from the design of the survey to the collection of the data to ultimately its visualization. Really pretty simple. So if you&rsquo;re fairly new to the game, it is probably going to make sense for you to start at the beginning and read the whole way through the book. Likewise, if you&rsquo;re familiar with some of the content, but not everything, there&rsquo;s no harm in just skipping to the chapters that are relevant to your case: you aren&rsquo;t going to be scrabmling to catch up if you skip around!</p>

<div data-type="warning">
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have much (or any) experience with survey design and data collection and visualization, it would probably be best to read this book all the way through before you start collecting your data. Some of the visualizations you want to make when everything is said and done might require some well-planned decisions up front. If you&rsquo;re reading this book part-by-part as you go, there&rsquo;s a better chance that you might consider something until it&rsquo;s too late!</p>

<h2>Common Terms and Definitions</h2>

<p>Throughout the book, there may be times when we introduce specialized terms and phrases that are rather specific to the topic being discussed. Whenever this is the case, we will provide a link to the term in our <a href="glossary01.html">glossary</a>. You&rsquo;re welcome to reference this at any time, but we do our best to point you in that direction when a new term is used.</p>

<h2>Advanced Chapters</h2>

<p>This book does contain some chapters that go a bit above and beyond just the basics that we think you should know. We do denote these chapters with an icon {{ICON HERE}} so that you know to expect a more in-depth look at the topic. Reading these chapters (although we recommend it!) is not necessary for an adequate understanding of the broader topic being discussed; however, there are times when we feel that it&rsquo;s useful to provide you with easy access to the information and that you could benefit from a more thorough understanding of the topic.</p>
