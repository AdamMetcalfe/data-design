  <h1>Preface</h1>
  <p data-type="author">By Trina Chiasson</p>
  
  <p>I had never written a book before, let alone an international, open-source book with more than 50 contributors from 14 different countries.</p> 

  <p>It started with a message on Kickstarter:</p>

  <blockquote>Hi Trina! Stats dork from Chicago here….Do you have any plans to include tutorials for basic data cleaning and data selection techniques for users who may not have any statistics background?</blockquote>

  <p>At the time, I had no idea that this simple message would turn into a book, a community, and a global movement to make information design more accessible.</p>

  <p>Dyanna Gregory was a statistical programmer who knew the challenges of teaching University-level stats to those who don’t identify as math-nerds. I was an entrepreneur building software to help less-technical people create interactive infographics and data visualizations. I was also a fellow at the Reynolds Journalism Institute where my goal was to find ways to simplify the process of creating data visualizations in newsrooms. I had launched a Kickstarter campaign to support my tech startup, and we had nearly 1,500 backers who were excited about breaking down barriers in data visualization.</p>

  <p>We all believed in the vision of making data simple.</p>

  <p>But working with data can be far from simple. Data comes in all kinds of different shapes, sizes, and flavors. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to collecting, understanding, and visualizing data. Some people spend years studying the topic through statistics, mathematics, design, and computer science. And many people want a bit of extra help getting started.</p>

  <p>Dyanna and I began talking about what a plain-language data resource would look like. Usability was a big priority for us. It’s hard to write a technical book that’s easy for less-technical readers to digest, but we believed that it was an important challenge to tackle. We wanted to create a free resource that was well-designed, joyful to read, and easy to understand.</p>

  <p>Of course, the information would need to be accurate and we wanted to cover a range of different data concepts. We needed technical writers with an in-depth understanding of data, math, and statistics. We also needed editors who could comb over the content to make adjustments for simplicity and understandability, while keeping a conversational tone. Our mission was to translate geek into non-geek — to make technical concepts more accessible to less-technical people.</p>

  <p>We made a call for contributors. People from all over the globe began telling us about their experiences working with data and design, or lack thereof. What struck me the most was the number of self-identified “non-math-people” who were hungry for a resource that could introduce them to data concepts in a manner that was simple, approachable, and even fun. They were happy to pitch in and volunteer their time to make it happen.</p>

  <p>Dyanna and I kicked off the project in February with a Write-A-Thon in Chicago. We invited writers, data analysts, programmers, designers, and others to come together in person and talk about the project as a whole. We thought through the process, talked about data, opened up our laptops, and started writing.</p>

  <p>After that, we contacted everyone who applied to contribute, and began figuring out who was going to do what. For an all-volunteer project with over 50 contributors spread across many time zones, it was important to stay organized. We found project managers for different sections of the book, chose writers and editors for each chapter, put together research and distribution teams, and established timelines.</p>

  <p>For me, the best part of this project was that I had the honor to work with some of the smartest, funniest, most creative people I’ve ever met. Again and again, I’ve been blown away by their creativity, passion, and support. Data + Design is truly a community effort. I’m beyond grateful that I had the experience of creating this book with such an incredible group of people.</p>

  <p>This book isn’t a final product. It’s the beginning of a community process to improve our collective understanding of data and design. We’re releasing the first edition now, and we’re already working on more chapters for future releases. We want you to get in touch and suggest improvements. This isn’t my book; it’s our book. Together we can build upon it, translate it, transform it, and make it better with every iteration.</p>

  <p>The book is open source and available on Github. It’s free for anyone to read, download, remix, and re-distribute for noncommercial purposes. We invite you to join us. Email <a href="mailto:ebook@infoactive.co" target="_blank">ebook@infoactive.co</a> to get involved.</p>

  <p>I also want to thank the Reynolds Journalism Institute (RJI) for supporting Data + Design, who played an instrumental role in making this project come to life.</p>
