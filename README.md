# How We're Licensed

*Data. Design.* is licensed under the terms of a [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode). The full legal code is at the link, but here's a quick human-readable breakdown for you as well. (Note: This is a human-readable summary of, and not a substitute for, the license.)

## By Attribution

If you use this book yourself, credit us! Basically, you just need to include a little snippet saying:

> Adapted from [Data. Design.](https://infoactive.co/data-design) by Trina Chiasson and Dyanna Gregory.
> Licensed under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. This work is not affiliated with or endorsed
> by the original authors.

Basically all you're saying is, "Hey, this was originally made by these peeps, go check it out. Any edits to this were made by me, not them." Pretty reasonable, right?

## Non-Commercial

If you fork and make edits to this book, you can't do it for monetary gain. The purpose of this book is to help people make better-informed decisions in collecting, analyzing, and presenting their data. And to do that free availability of this book is kind of a big deal. So don't sell it, mmkay?

## Share Alike

Finally, your version has to be licensed under the same terms as this one is. No telling people they can sell their derivatives, no telling people they don't have to attribute back to the original. Basically, just keep everything free and open.

## Well, What If...

Of course there are edge cases. There are times when you're just not going to be sure if doing `X` of `Y` will be kosher with the license or not. That's fine! Just [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/infoactive/data-design/issues) and let us know what's up. We'll talk it over and help you figure out if what you want to do is cool beans or if you should tweak your plans a little bit. It never hurts to ask!

# Can I Make Edits?

Of course you can! That's part of the reason we're making this book totally openly sourced. We love when the community takes the time and effort to contribute to things like this. There are two different routes we recommend, depending on what you want to do.

## Fork Us!

This is the best option if you want to go off in your own direction, or just want your own copy of the source for reference, or generally just don't think that you're in the mood to add a new chapter. For most people, this is the best option.

What's even better? This is super easy to do. Just go [to the repository](https://github.com/infoactive/data-design) and click `Fork` in the upper right corner. Voila! You're now the proud owner of a brand spanking new Data. Design. repository.

## Fork Us! (Redux)

Hey, wait a minute! What's up with this, didn't you say there were *two* routes? This is just the same thing all over again!

Whoops. You got us there. As it turns out, the first step is the same for both people who want to contribute back to our repo and those who don't: you just gotta fork it.

But alright, let's say you've got a great idea for a new chapter. What's the process for getting it accepted and published look like? Well,

1. Fork the main repository and [keep it synced](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
2. Open an [issue with us](https://github.com/infoactive/data-design/issues) and label it as a question. Let everyone know what you're thinking. Even if you have a great chapter idea, we can't guarantee that there's a good spot in the book to put it and we don't want you spending hours of your time writing something that we'll end up rejecting. Get feedback on the idea and make sure that it'll be a chapter we can use.
3. Start authoring! Here's where your fork comes in handy: you'll be making all chapter edits there.
4. Get reviewers. Go back to your GitHub issue, check with the commenters there, and see who would be willing to review your chapter for content, grammar, and style. Add them as contributors on your fork, let them make edits, etc.
5. Once you all think that the chapter's in a good place, create a pull request back to the main repository. That's when we'll go through and do an 'official' edit and suggest any changes we'd like to see before accepting your chapter.
6. Publish! We'll accept your pull request and you'll offically have a chapter in *Data. Design.* Congratulate yourself on a job well done and make sure that we didn't forget to add your information to our page of contributors.
