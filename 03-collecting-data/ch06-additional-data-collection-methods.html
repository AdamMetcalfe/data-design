<h1>Additional Data Collection Methods</h1>
</header>

<section data-type="sect1">
<p>Not all types of information are easily gathered using surveys. Surveys are self-report tools that take place at a single point in time, so exact measurements, external impressions of reactions, and data about things that happen over time can be difficult to capture, but these are important pieces of information that you may need. Let&rsquo;s discuss a few of the other data collection tools you can use to better collect these types of data.</p>

<h2>Direct Measurement</h2>

<p>There are some variables that should be measured rather than surveyed if you're trying to obtain an exact, correct number. Many medical variables, for example, are difficult if not impossible to gather accurately using a survey. Let's say you need to collect data on participants' weight at the beginning of a study. There are a few common reasons someone might report an inaccurate number.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lack of information: they didn&rsquo;t actually know how much they weighed when asked</li>
	<li>Social expectation: they felt there was a &quot;correct&quot; answer they were supposed to give</li>
	<li>Ease of response: they knew about how much they weighed but didn&rsquo;t think the exact answer was needed; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about 170 lbs, so I&rsquo;ll say that.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether your data need to be completely correct depends on how you're using the the information. If you're not concerned about having an exact measurement and an estimate will work, then a survey might be fine, as long as it's something people will be able to reasonably estimate. If you have a variable is likely to be incorrectly self-reported and it is important that these data are current and accurate, direct measurement should be used instead of a survey.</p>

<p>In <a class="glossterm" target="_blank" href="glossary01.html#measurement-direct">direct measurement</a>, you use an appropriate device to measure the variable and then record the value in the data set. This is often done for health-related variables that a person wouldn&rsquo;t be able to just know. The measurements are usually captured on forms and the data is transferred from the forms into the data set.</p>

<p>It is important for your forms to be clear about how you want the measurement to be recorded. You should indicate the preferred units and the precision you want the measurement captured with. One of the easiest ways to communicate this is by allotting a specific number of boxes so the person taking the measurement knows how many digits you want recorded.</p>

<p>The image below shows an example for how we might set up a form for capturing adult weight. Here, we want the measurement in pounds, and we want the number recorded to two digits after the decimal place.</p>
{insert graphic here and talk about specificity in forms design}

<p>When relevant, include a place to record what device was used to take the measurement.</p>

<h2>Focus Groups</h2>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s helpful to watch people while they&rsquo;re responding to your questions, see their thought processes, and observe them interacting with others. You may also have a wider variety of topics you would like to cover than would make sense for a survey or you might not be sure exactly what questions need to be asked yet. <a class="glossterm" target="_blank" href="glossary01.html#group-focus">Focus groups</a> can help in all these situations.</p>

<h2>Diaries</h2>

<p>Diary forms can be useful if you&rsquo;re collecting data from people about things that are happening over extended periods of time. They are particularly helpful if you need to record a lot of details that could easily be misremembered or forgotten.</p>

<p>You might have seen something similar to this before:</p>

<p><a class="glossterm" target="_blank" href="glossary01.html#diary">Diary</a> forms are often used for tracking things like meals, medications, or exercise but can be used for anything you want to record over time. They can be paper forms or computerized, but should the same design principles as surveys. Fields should be well-labeled and the instructions should be very clear about what information should be entered in each field.</p>
