<h1>Types of Survey Questions</h1>
</header>

  <section data-type="sect1">
<p>After you’ve decided what type of survey you’re using, you need to figure out what kinds of questions to include. A question type determines what level of data gets collected, which in turn affects what you can do with the data later on. For example, if you ask about age and you record it as a number (e.g. 21, 34, 42), you’ll have numeric data that you can perform math operations on.  If you instead ask for a person’s age group (e.g. 18-24, 25-34, 35-44), you’ll have ordered categorical data.  You’ll be able to count how many people were in each group, but you won’t be able to find the mean age of your respondents. Before you create your survey, it’s very important to consider how you want to analyze your final results so you can pick question types that will give you the right kind of data for those analyses.</p>


<h3>Open versus Closed questions (collecting qualitative versus quantitative data)</h3>

<p>Open (or open-ended) questions are used when you want to collect long-form qualitative data. You ask the person a question without offering any specific answers from which to choose. This is often a good option to discover new ideas you may have overlooked or did not know existed. In a closed question, specific answers are offered when asking the question. Closed questions are used when you already have an idea what categories your answers will fall into or you're only interested in the frequency of particular answers.</p>

<p>Let’s pretend you work for an ice cream parlour called Fictionals. You want to know why some people don’t come to your store. Here are open and closed questions you could ask to find out their reasons.</p>


<figure><img alt="Open vs. Closed Questions" src="../images/sections/03/open-vs-closed.png" /></figure>

<p>In the closed question, you offer the most probable reasons why people would not go eat ice cream at your store, while in the open question, you just ask why they don’t eat at Fictionals and allow respondents to answer however they want. </p>

<p>When you ask an open-ended question you gain new insight on why some people might not try your ice cream: it’s not because they don’t like ice cream or they don’t like Fictionals, it’s because they can’t eat it! With this new insight, you could choose to offer a new type of ice cream and attract a clientele you didn’t have before.</p>

<p>This is a distinct advantage open-ended questions have, and it’s particularly useful if you’re doing exploratory research and will primarily be reading through the responses to get a sense of how people responded. However, it can take extra work to analyze and summarize this data.</p>

<p>When you think that most people will probably give more or less the same answers, you can combine an open and closed question to get the best results. Here is how the same question would look if you transformed it into a combined open and closed question:</p>

<figure><img alt="Closed/Open Question" src="../images/sections/03/open-and-closed.png" /></figure>

<h2>Closed question types</h2>

<h3>Multiple choice questions</h3>

<p>Sometimes you'll want the respondent to select only one of several answers. If your survey is online, you use radio buttons (or circles), which indicate to choose just one item. If you want to allow the respondent to choose more than one option, you should use a checkbox instead. Here is what it looks like in practice:</p>

<figure><img alt="Radio vs. Checkbox" src="../images/sections/03/radio-vs-checkbox.png" /></figure>

<p>If your survey is a paper or administered survey, you would use printed or verbal directions to indicate how many options the respondent should pick (e.g. "Please choose one," "Please select up to 3," "Please select all that apply").  </p>

<p>Answer choices should not overlap and should cover all possible options.  This is called having "mutually exclusive and exhaustive" categories and it is <em>very</em> important for survey design. Consider the situation below.</p>

<figure><img alt="Radio vs. Checkbox" src="../images/sections/03/ageproblem.png" /></figure>

<p>In the left set of choices, someone who is 25 wouldn't know whether to select the 18-25 button or the 25-35 button, and someone who is 50 wouldn't have any button to select at all!  The set of age categories on the right is better because it includes all possible age groups, the age choices don't overlap, and it allows people the choice to withhold the information if they choose to. </p>

<div data-type="warning"><p>{ insert warning box with short set of info from data cleaning chapter about the Prefer not to answer choice }</p></div>

<p> It won't always be practical to list every possible option. In that case, including "None of the above" or "Other" choices comes in handy.  This makes it less likely that people will just skip the question and leave you with missing data.  You may also consider including a "Not Applicable" (i.e. "N/A") choice for questions that may not apply to all of your respondents, or a "Don't know" choice for questions where a respondent may not not have the information available. </p>

<h3>Dichotomous questions</h3>

<p>Dichotomous questions are a specific type of multiple choice used when there only two possible answers are given to a question. Here are some classic examples of dichotomous type questions:</p>

<figure><img alt="dichotomous questions" src="../images/sections/03/dichotomous.png" /></figure>


<p>You can use dichotomous questions to determine if a respondent is suited to respond to the next question. This is called a filter or contingency question. Filters can get very complex, so try not to use more than two or three filter questions in a row. Here’s an example of the logic behind a filter question:</p>


<figure><img alt="Fictional's Flow Chart" src="../images/sections/03/fictionals.png" /></figure>

<p>In an online survey or administered survey, answering "Yes" to the question "Do you ever eat ice cream at Fictionals Ice Cream Parlour?" would take a respondent to the question about how often they do, while selecting "No" would open the checkbox response question about the reasons for not eating there.  In a paper survey, all questions would need to be listed on the page and couldn't be presented conditionally based on a specific response.  You could use a flowchart form like in the diagram above, or you could employ skip directions, as illustrated below.</p>

<figure><img alt="dichotomous questions" src="../images/sections/03/paper.png" /></figure>



<h2>Scaled questions</h2>

<p>Scaled questions are used to measure people’s attitudes, opinions, lifestyles and environments. There are many different types but the most commonly used are Likert[1] and slider scales. The main difference between the two is that a Likert scale consists of ordered categories while a slider scale allows respondents to make a mark indicating their response anywhere along the scale. As a result, a Likert scale-type question will give you data that is measured at an ordinal level, while a slider scale will give you data that is measured at an interval level.</p>

<figure><img alt="Likert vs. Slider Scale" src="../images/sections/03/likert-vs-slider.png" /></figure>

<p>In the example above, the same question is asked twice, once with a Likert scale and once with a sliding scale. Notice that in the Likert scale there are five categories. Scales with an odd number of categories allow participants to agree, disagree or indicate their neutrality, while scales with an even number of categories only allow participants to agree or disagree. If you want to allow for neutrality, scales with an odd number of categories are usually preferred; however, you should use an even number if you want to require the respondent to choose one direction or the other. This is called a “forced question.”</p>


<h3>Likert scale</h3>

<p>Likert scales are usually limited to a five-category scale, as it is difficult to create a greater number of sensible categories using text. The most common Likert scales you will find are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><em>Opinions and attitudes:</em> &ldquo;How much do you agree with&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Possible answers: Strongly agree, agree, neither agree or disagree, disagree, strongly disagree.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Frequency:</em> &ldquo;How often do you&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Possible answers: Always, often, sometimes, rarely, never.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Quality:</em> &ldquo;In general, how do you rate the quality of&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Possible answers: Excellent, very good, good, fair, poor.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Importance:</em> &ldquo;How important would you say {topic} is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Possible answers: Very important, important, somewhat important, not at all important.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Slider scale</h2>

<p>Slider scales are useful when you want to have a more precise reading of a respondent’s answer.  These scales are most easily implemented in an online survey, since the computer will calculate the position of the marker; when used on a paper survey, you will need to have someone measure the marker's location on the scale manually. Some people think that slider scales are better than Likert scales because they are more interactive for respondents, but this is specifically in an online context. Slider scales are practical when conducting a survey that is being translated into multiple languages, as text categories are not always easy to translate.</p>

<figure><img alt="sliding scale" src="../images/sections/03/sliding-scale.png" /></figure>

<div data-type="warning">
<p>When creating a scale, whether Likert or slider, never forget to label the first and last points in your scale. Otherwise, your respondents may misinterpret your scale, creating errors in your data.</p>
</div>

<h2>Question wording</h2>

<p>It's extremely important to think about how you word your questions when developing your survey. Here are a few key things to keep in mind:</p>

<h3>Focus</h3>

<p>Each question should be specific and only have one focus.</p>

<div data-type="example">
<p>How many times have you eaten ice cream in the last month?</p>
</div>

<p>This question focuses on one issue (frequency of ice cream eating) and is specific (a certain time period).</p>

<div class="neutral" data-type="example">
<p>Do you avoid eating ice cream because you are on a diet? [Answer: Yes, I avoid ice cream, but not because I am on a diet]</p>
</div>

<p>This question is bad because it focuses on two different issues. You should not use the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; if it is connecting two different ideas. Instead, you could use filter questions to obtain the desired information. For example:</p>

<figure><img alt="Fictional's Flow Chart" src="../images/sections/03/fictionals-flow-chart.png" /></figure>

<h3>Precision</h3>

<p>Not everyone will interpret all words in the same way, even if they are simple. You can define terms with a lead-in built into the question. Try to reduce ambiguity and the use of double negatives.</p>

<table class="custom yes-and-no">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Do</th>
			<th>Don&rsquo;t</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Have you eaten chocolate ice cream in the past month?</li>
				<li>Ice cream with peanuts should not be permitted.</li>
				<li>Ice cream vendors should not disclaim having a peanut-free shop.</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Rocky Road, Mint Chocolate Chip, Dutch Chocolate and Hot Fudge ice creams are Fictionals&rsquo; best sellers. Have you eaten any chocolate ice cream in the last month?</li>
				<li>Ice cream with peanuts should be banned.</li>
				<li>Ice cream vendors should accept to have a peanut-free shop.</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Brevity</h3>

<p>Your questions should be relatively short, except where additional wording is necessary to provide context or to clarify terminology.</p>

<table class="custom yes-and-no">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Do</th>
			<th>Don&rsquo;t</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Do: Please list your three favorite ice creams in order of preference.</td>
			<td>Don&rsquo;t: Can you please tell us what ice cream flavors you like and what are your first, second and third favorite?</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Biased and leading questions</h3>

<p>Biased or <a class="glossterm" target="_blank" href="glossary01.html#question-leading">leading questions</a> can easily skew your answers if you do not pay close attention to how you use words, especially strong ones. Avoid overemphasizing statements and keep an eye out for questions that create &ldquo;social desirability effects&rdquo; where people will answer according to what society views as &ldquo;proper&rdquo; or a desirable behavior.</p>

<table class="custom yes-and-no">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Do</th>
			<th>Don&rsquo;t</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Do you agree that all ice cream vendors in our city should offer peanut-free products?</td>
			<td>Do you agree that ice cream vendors that serve peanuts are a severe hazard for the well-being of our children?</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Notice how the second question tries to bias the respondent by using strong or affective words such as &ldquo;severe&rdquo;, &ldquo;hazard&rdquo;, &ldquo;well-being&rdquo;, and &ldquo;children&rdquo;. Even the first one is a bit leading with the use of the word &ldquo;all&rdquo;. The better question would be:</p>

<div data-type="example">
<p>Do you agree that ice cream vendors in our city should offer peanut-free products?</p>
</div>

<h3>A few final things...</h3>

<p>Finally, there are few last things to consider when developing your survey questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If appropriate for your data, consider varying the type of questions you use to keep your respondents engaged throughout the survey. You have a variety of questions types to choose from, so mix it up while keeping in mind that each type of question has a specific purpose.</li>
	<li>Think about how certain words can have different interpretations and remember that meanings are often embedded in culture and language. Be sensitive to different cultures if you are examining several groups within a population.</li>
</ul>






<h2>Designing your questionnaire</h2>
<p>Once you’ve identified the purpose of your survey and chosen which type you will use, the next step is to design the questionnaire itself. In this section, we’ll look at the structure, layout and ordering of questions. We’ll also talk about some key things to keep in mind once you’re done.</p>

<h3>Questionnaire structure</h3>
<p>Do you remember when you were taught in grade school that every essay should have an introduction, body and conclusion? Questionnaires should also have a certain structure. The parts of a questionnaire are the introduction, main topic, transitions between topics, demographic questions, and conclusion.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Always start your survey with a brief introduction which explains:
	<ul>
		<li>the purpose of the survey</li>
		<li>who is conducting it</li>
		<li>the voluntary nature of the participant’s involvement</li>
		<li>the respect of confidentiality</li>
		<li>time required to complete the survey</li>

	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Main topics</h3>
<p>Generally, it is best to start with easy questions and then move on to harder, or more specific questions.

	<ul>
		<li>Ask about objective facts before asking more subjective questions.</li>
		<li>Order questions from the most familiar to least.</li>
		<li>Make sure that the answer for a question does not diminish the impact of the next one. There should be logic in the order.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Transition between topics</h3>
<p>Use transitions between groups of questions to explain a new topic or format. For example:
“The next few questions are related to the frequency of your TV viewing habits. Please choose the answer that best describes your situation.”
</p>

<h3>Demographic questions</h3>
<p>Unless you are using demographic questions as filtering criteria for survey eligibility, It is usually best to put them near the end of a survey. Typical demographic questions include:
	<ul>
		<li>Gender</li>
		<li>Age</li>
		<li>Income</li>
		<li>Nationality or Location</li>
		<li>Education</li>
		<li>Civil status</li>
		<li>Cultural background</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Thank the participant for their contribution and explain how it has been valuable to the project. Reiterate that their identity will be kept confidential and that results will be anonymized. If you wish, you can also include your contact information in case they have any additional questions related to the survey and ask for their contact information if you are offering an incentive for completing the survey.
</p>

<p>If you contact respondents in advance to invite them to participate in the survey, you should also explain why they have been selected to participate, when the survey will take place and how they can access it.</p>

<h3>General layout</h3>
<p>There are a few good rules to follow when designing the general layout of your survey.
	<ul>
		<li>Put your introduction and conclusion on separate pages from your questions.</li>
		<li>The format should be easy to follow and understand.</li>
		<li>Check that filter questions work as intended.</li>
		<li>Stick to questions that meet your goals rather than just asking questions you think might be important. In general, survey completion rates tend to diminish as surveys become longer. </li>
		<li>Leave enough space for respondents to answer open-ended questions.</li>
		<li>Make sure to include all likely answers for closed-ended questions, including an “other” option in case respondents feel that none of the provided answers suit them. Where appropriate, also include “Not Applicable” and a “Choose not to respond” options.</li>  
		<li>Ensure that questions flow well and follow a certain sequence of logic. Begin the survey with more general questions and then follow with more specific or harder issues. Finish with general demographic topics (e.g. age, gender, etc.), unless you are using demographic questions to screen for eligibility at the beginning of the survey.  Group questions by theme or topic.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><b>A few last things to keep in mind...</b></p>
<h3>Consider your audience</h3>
<p>Think about the people who will be participating in your survey. Let’s say that you want to do a survey in a school where many students have recently immigrated to the country as refugees with their families, and don’t speak the local language very well.</p>

<p>In what language(s) should you conduct the survey? Should you only conduct the survey in the local language or instead prepare the survey in several languages?  If you’re preparing different versions of the survey, who will ensure consistency between the translations?</p>
<p>What kind of vocabulary should you use? These are students, not professors. You will probably want to use fairly basic language, especially if many are not native speakers. We have not specified their age, but it would be useful to take this information into consideration when thinking about vocabulary.</p>
<p>Is the use of certain colors, font or images appropriate or useful? In this case, images and fun fonts are probably very practical to engage with a young target audience. However, it is important to consider cultural sensitivities. Certain images or use of colors could evoke negative thoughts or sentiments in people, especially from children who have suffered from traumatic events or who come from war-torn countries.</p>

<h3>Word your instructions and questions clearly and specifically</h3>
<p>It is important that your instructions and questions are simple and coherent. You want to make sure that everyone understands and interprets the survey in the same way. For example, consider the difference between the following two questions.  

	<ul>
		<li>When did you first notice symptoms? ______________________</li>
		<li>When did you first notice symptoms (e.g. MM/YYYY)? __ __ / __ __ __ __</li>	
	</ul>	

</p>

<p>If you want the question to be open to interpretation so that people can give answers like, “after I came back from my last trip,” then the first option is okay.  However, if you’re really wondering how long each person has been experiencing symptoms, the second version of the question lets the respondent know that you’re specifically interested in the month and year the symptoms first occurred.</p>  

<h3>Pay attention to length</h3>
<p>We often want to collect as much information as possible when conducting a survey. However, extremely long surveys quickly become tedious to answer. Participants get tired or bored, which decreases the completion rate. After a while, you risk getting false answers from people who are trying to finish the survey as rapidly as possible. When reviewing your questionnaire, ask yourself, “Do I really need this question? Will it bring any valuable data that can contribute to my reason for doing this survey?”</p>

<h3>Track progress</h3>
<p>It is good to indicate the respondent’s progress as they advance through the survey. It gives them an idea of their progression and encourages them to continue on. In a self-administered survey, a progress bar such as the one below could be placed at the beginning of each new section or transition.</p>

<figure><img alt="Fictional's Flow Chart" src="../images/sections/03/progress-bar.png" /></figure>

<p>In an administered survey, the interviewer can simply make statements such as:<br />
“We are halfway done.”<br />
“There are only two more sections left.”<br />
“Only a few more questions to answer.”
</p>

<h3>Train interviewers</h3>
<p>If you are conducting an administered survey, you will have to prepare your interviewers ahead of time, explain their tasks, and make sure that they understand all the questions properly. You may also want them to be supervised when they are first conducting the survey to monitor quality control and interviewer effects.</p>

<h3>Pre-testing</h3>
<p>Pre-testing means testing your survey with a few initial respondents before officially going out in the field. This allows you to get feedback to improve issues you might have with length, technical problems, or question ordering and wording. Sometimes this this step gets skipped if there’s a tight deadline to meet, but don’t underestimate the value of pre-testing. It can save a lot of time and money in the end.</p>

<h3>Anonymize responses</h3>
<p>We briefly mentioned response anonymization earlier when we talked about questionnaire structure. Sometimes, people are afraid to give an honest response for fear that it might be traced back to them. By anonymizing responses you will get more accurate data while protecting the identity of your participants.  There are times when you may need to keep respondents’ contact information associated with their responses, like if you’ll be conducting a follow-up survey and will need to know what their initial answers were.  Be clear in your survey about whether you’re anonymizing responses or not so respondents know if you’re storing their contact information. </p>
<p><b>You should always anonymize any results you present, whether the data you collect is anonymous or not.</b></p>   

<h3>Incentives</h3>
<p>The use of incentives can be contentious. You want to encourage as many people as possible to participate in your survey, but you also don’t want people completing the survey just to get a reward, since they may have been giving arbitrary answers to finish it quickly.</p>

<p>If the survey is very long and time consuming, consider giving a small reward or stipend if a respondent completes the questionnaire. If the survey is shorter, consider doing a prize drawing from respondents who complete the survey and provide their contact information.</p>



<p>As you have noticed, there are a number of factors you will need to consider when you’re designing your survey and deciding what types of question to use. Survey creation can seem daunting at first, but remember this is the foundation of your data analysis. Getting this step right will make the rest of your work much easier later on. </p>
