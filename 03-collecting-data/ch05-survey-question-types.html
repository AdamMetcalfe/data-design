<h1>Types of Survey Questions</h1>
</header>

  <section data-type="sect1">
<p>Once you have chosen the type of survey you will conduct, you will have to start thinking about the types of questions you will use. There are all sorts of questions that you can employ. It all depends of course on what type of data you are looking to collect.</p>

<h3>Open versus Closed questions (collecting qualitative versus quantitative data)</h3>

<p>Open or <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#question-open">open-ended questions</a> are used when you want to collect qualitative data. These are normally employed when you want to get more details on a specific area. This means you ask the person a question without offering any specific answers from which to choose. This is often a good option to discover new aspects, reasons or phenomena you may have overlooked or did not know existed.</p>

<p>Closed questions are just the opposite. Numerous answers are offered when asking the question. <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#question-open">Closed questions</a> are used when we want to measure something in a very specific way and we want to collect quantitative data.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a new example. Pretend that you work for an ice cream parlour called Fictionals (yes, we made up the name). You want to know why some people do not go and buy ice cream at your store. Here is how you could ask an open and closed question.</p>

<figure><img alt="Open vs. Closed Questions" src="../images/sections/03/open-vs-closed.png" /></figure>

<p>In the closed question, we offer the most probable reasons why people would not go eat ice cream at our store. However, you will notice that when we ask an open-ended question we gain new insight on why some people might not try our ice cream: it&rsquo;s not because they don&rsquo;t like ice cream or they don&rsquo;t like us (or our product), it&rsquo;s because they can&rsquo;t eat it! With this new insight, Fictionals is able to offer a new type of ice cream and attract a clientele it once did not have.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are advantages to asking open-ended questions. The problem is that it is tedious work to code qualitative data, even with the help of a computer program or application. When you think that most people will probably give more or less the same answers, you can combine an open and closed question to get the best results. Here is how the same question would look if you transformed it into a combined open and closed question:</p>

<h3>Dichotomous questions</h3>

<p><a class="glossterm xref " data-temp="xref" href="#question-dichotomous">Dichotomous questions</a> are when there only two possible answers are given to a question. Here are some classic examples of dichotomous type questions:</p>

<figure><img alt="dichotomous questions" src="../images/sections/03/dichotomous.png" /></figure>

<div data-type="warning">
<p>A large sequence of dichotomous questions (ex. true or false) in a survey can bore respondents, causing them to give random answers in order to finish sooner. Try to spread them out throughout your survey if you must use many.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes you will use dichotomous questions to determine if a respondent is suited to respond to a next question. This is called a filter or contingency question. Filters can get very complex, so try to limit the number of filter questions you use to two or three. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<figure><img alt="Fictional's Flow Chart" src="../images/sections/03/fictionals.png" /></figure>

<h3>Multiple choice questions</h3>

<p>Anyone who has ever passed an exam has probably already answered a multiple-choice question. Sometimes in surveys we want the respondent to choose only one among several answers. In this case, we use <em>radio</em> buttons (or circles), which indicate to only choose one item. When we want the respondent to choose more than one option, we use a <em>checkbox</em> instead. Here is what it looks like in practice:</p>

<figure><img alt="Radio vs. Checkbox" src="../images/sections/03/radio-vs-checkbox.png" /></figure>

<h3>Scaled questions</h3>

<p><a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#question-scaled">Scaled question</a> are used to measure people&rsquo;s attitudes, opinions, lifestyles and environments. There are many different types but the most commonly used are Likert[1] and sliding scales. The main difference between the two is that a Likert scale uses text categories while a sliding scale uses numbers.</p>

<figure><img alt="Likert vs. Slider Scale" src="../images/sections/03/likert-vs-slider.png" /></figure>

<p>In the example above, the same question is asked twice, once with a Likert scale and once with a sliding scale. Notice that in the Likert scale there are five categories while in the sliding scale there are seven. Normally in a scaled question we either use 5, 7 or 10-point scales.</p>

<p>These are odd number scales that allow participants to agree, disagree or indicate their neutrality (a 10-point scale includes 0, making it an odd number scale). An even number scale, such as a 4 or 6-point scale, only allows participants to agree or disagree. This is why the odd number scales are usually preferred, although there are times when you might want to to use an even number scale if you consider that there is no room for &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; in the question or you want to obligate the respondent to choose one or the other. This is what we call a <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#question-forced">forced question</a>.</p>

<h3>Likert scale</h3>

<p><a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#scale-likert">Likert scales</a> are usually limited to a five-category scale. This is because it is difficult to create a greater number of categories using text. The most common Likert scales your will find are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><em>Opinions and attitudes:</em> &ldquo;How much do you agree with&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Possible answers: Strongly agree, agree, neither agree or disagree, disagree, strongly disagree.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Frequency:</em> &ldquo;How often do you&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Possible answers: Always, often, sometimes, rarely, never.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Quality:</em> &ldquo;In general, how do you rate the quality of&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Possible answers: Excellent, very good, good, fair, poor.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Importance:</em> &ldquo;How important would you say {topic} is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Possible answers: Very important, important, somewhat important, not at all important.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sliding scale</h2>

<p>A sliding scale is useful when you want to have a more accurate reading of the respondent&rsquo;s answer and is most beneficial in an online survey. Some people think that sliding scales are better than Likert scales because they are more interactive for respondents, but this is specifically in an online context. Sliding scales are extremely practical when conducting a multi-lingual survey, as text categories are not always very easy to translate.</p>

<figure><img alt="sliding scale" src="../images/sections/03/sliding-scale.png" /></figure>

<div data-type="warning">
<p>When creating a sliding scale, never forget to label the first and last points in your scale. Otherwise, your respondents may misinterpret your scale, creating errors in your data.</p>
</div>

<h2>Question wording</h2>

<p>It is extremely important to think about how you word your questions when developing your survey. Here are a few key things to keep in mind:</p>

<h3>Focus</h3>

<p>Each question should be specific and only have one focus.</p>

<div data-type="example">
<p>How many times have you eaten ice cream in the last month?</p>
</div>

<p>This question focuses on one issue (frequency of ice cream eating) and is specific (a certain time period).</p>

<div class="neutral" data-type="example">
<p>Do you avoid eating ice cream because you are on a diet? [Answer: Yes, I avoid ice cream, but not because I am on a diet]</p>
</div>

<p>This question is bad because it focuses on two different issues. You should not use the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; if it is connecting two different ideas. Instead, you could use filter questions to obtain the desired information. For example:</p>

<figure><img alt="Fictional's Flow Chart" src="../images/sections/03/fictionals-flow-chart.png" /></figure>

<h3>Precision</h3>

<p>Not everyone will interpret all words in the same way, even if they are simple. You can define terms with a lead-in built into the question. Try to reduce ambiguity and the use of double negatives.</p>

<table class="custom yes-and-no">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Do</th>
			<th>Don&rsquo;t</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Have you eaten chocolate ice cream in the past month?</li>
				<li>Ice cream with peanuts should not be permitted.</li>
				<li>Ice cream vendors should not disclaim having a peanut-free shop.</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
			<ul>
				<li>Rocky Road, Mint Chocolate Chip, Dutch Chocolate and Hot Fudge ice creams are Fictionals&rsquo; best sellers. Have you eaten any chocolate ice cream in the last month?</li>
				<li>Ice cream with peanuts should be banned.</li>
				<li>Ice cream vendors should accept to have a peanut-free shop.</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Brevity</h3>

<p>Your questions should be relatively short, except where additional wording is necessary to provide context or to clarify terminology.</p>

<table class="custom yes-and-no">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Do</th>
			<th>Don&rsquo;t</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Do: Please list your three favorite ice creams in order of preference.</td>
			<td>Don&rsquo;t: Can you please tell us what ice cream flavors you like and what are your first, second and third favorite?</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Biased and leading questions</h3>

<p>Biased or <a class="glossterm" data-temp="xref" href="#question-leading">leading questions</a> can easily skew your answers if you do not pay close attention to how you use words, especially strong ones. Avoid overemphasizing statements and keep an eye out for questions that create &ldquo;social desirability effects&rdquo; where people will answer according to what society views as &ldquo;proper&rdquo; or a desirable behavior.</p>

<table class="custom yes-and-no">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Do</th>
			<th>Don&rsquo;t</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Do you agree that all ice cream vendors in our city should offer peanut-free products?</td>
			<td>Do you agree that ice cream vendors that serve peanuts are a severe hazard for the well-being of our children?</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Notice how the second question tries to bias the respondent by using strong or affective words such as &ldquo;severe&rdquo;, &ldquo;hazard&rdquo;, &ldquo;well-being&rdquo;, and &ldquo;children&rdquo;. Even the first one is a bit leading with the use of the word &ldquo;all&rdquo;. The better question would be:</p>

<div data-type="example">
<p>Do you agree that ice cream vendors in our city should offer peanut-free products?</p>
</div>

<h3>A few final things...</h3>

<p>Finally, there are few last things to consider when developing your survey questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be sure to vary the type of questions you use to keep your respondents engaged throughout the whole survey. Remember, don&rsquo;t just use one type question (eg. true/false questions). You have a variety to choose from. So mix it up while keeping in mind that each type of question has a specific purpose.</li>
	<li>Also include a &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not applicable&rdquo; option among your answers when it makes sense (usually in your multiple choice and yes-no questions). You will have more precise results and may actually come across some unexpected insight.</li>
	<li>Think about how certain words can have different interpretations and remember that meanings are often embedded in culture and language. Be sensitive to different cultures if you are examining several groups within a population.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you have noticed, there are many things to plan and reflect upon when designing a survey. We&rsquo;ve only presented a very broad overview of survey design. You can find much more information online or at the library.</p>

<p>It can seem long and daunting at first, but just remember that this is will be the foundation of your data analysis. If you get this step right, you will collect much better data and make the rest of your work much easier! Good luck!</p>
