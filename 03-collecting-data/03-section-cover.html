  <h1>Collecting Data</h1>
  <p>Once you know what ingredients you’re putting into your recipe, you have to collect them. You could go to the closest grocery store to grab everything, but if you want to create an <em>excellent</em> dish, you’ll want to start with just the right ingredients. You should consider where to buy each item; some places offer wider selection or better quality of what you want.  You may prefer to get your produce from your favorite farmer or your bread from a nearby baker.</p>

<p>You also need to decide what types of each ingredient you want to include.  If a recipe calls for bell peppers but doesn't say what kind, you have to pick which colors to use. Do some items need to be a specific brand or variety?  If you’re making a strawberry pie, you may have a favorite type of strawberry you <em>must</em> have, but you may not care what baking soda you get, as long as it works.</p>  

<p>When you don’t have time to go shopping, you can give someone else money and have them do it for you.  You don’t always get exactly what you want, but that's the tradeoff for not going to the store yourself.  Don’t have enough cash or need something immediately?  Most of us have borrowed a cup of sugar or an egg from a neighbor at some point! </p>   

<p>Gathering data is similar to this.  Just as you could buy everything from the closest grocer, you <em>could</em>get all your information by asking open-ended questions on paper surveys that you pass out to people in a random public place - but that wouldn’t make sense.  Different types of data are best collected in different sorts of ways from different places, so you need to think about exactly what data you want and where to best get it, and sometimes you might not have enough time or money to collect the data you need by yourself.</p>   

<p>In this section, we’ll talk about data collection methods to help you figure out where and how to best obtain the information you’re looking for and how to sort out what information you really need.  Let’s go shopping!</p>
