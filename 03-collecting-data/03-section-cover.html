  <h1>Collecting Data</h1>
  <p>Once you know what sorts of ingredients are supposed to go into your recipe, what purpose each serves, and what you can and can’t do with them, you have to go out and gather them up. You <i>could</i> go to the local grocery store and grab the first cheese you see, the first onions, and so on, but if you want to create a really excellent dish, you’ll want to start with just the right ingredients. </p>

<p>This means you’ll need to take the time to think about where you want to buy each thing – some stores have better meats, fish, and dairy, and depending on the season, you may want to any vegetables or fruits you need from a particular outdoor market.  You might know a bakery that has the best bread in town or a shop that has the freshest spices.</p>  
<p>You’ll also need to decide what types of each ingredient you want to include.  If a recipe calls for bell peppers but doesn’t say what kind, you need to pick between green, red, orange, and yellow.  Maybe you want to include all four!</p>  

<p>Lastly, you need to decide which items need to be of a particular brand or variety and which it’s okay to grab whatever is cheapest.  If you’re making a strawberry pie and you have a favorite type of strawberry to use, you’ll want to make sure to try to find that kind of strawberry at the market - but you may not care what baking soda you get, as long as it works.</p>  

<p>Sometimes, when you just don’t have time to go shopping yourself, you give someone else a list and have them go do it for you.  You don’t always get exactly what you want, but that’s the tradeoff for not having to go to the store yourself.  And if you don’t have the cash to get everything you need or you need something immediately that you forgot to grab?  Well, most of us have borrowed a cup of sugar or an egg from a neighbor at some point!</p>   
<p>Gathering data is similar to this.  Just like you could head down to the local store to buy everything, you <i>could</i> always get all of your information by asking open-ended questions on a paper survey that you pass out to people in a random public place - but that wouldn’t make sense.  Different types of data are best collected in different sorts of ways from different places, and sometimes you don’t have enough time or money to collect all the data you need by yourself.</p>   
<p>In this section, we’ll talk about data collection methods to help you figure out where and how to best obtain the information you’re looking for and how to sort out what information you really need.  Let’s go shopping!</p>
