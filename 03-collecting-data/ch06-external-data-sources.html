    <h1>Finding external data</h1>
  </hgroup>
  <section data-type="sect1">

  <p>In addition to working with your own data, there may be times when you are using someone else’s set or would like to bring in other data to supplement your findings. Using external data offers several benefits:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Time / Cost: There is minimal work required on your end to collect and prepare the data for analysis.</li>
    <li>Access: You can work with data that you are not able to collect yourself or require more resources than you have available.</li>
    <li>Community: By finding a network of people interested in the same topic and sharing your data or doing research on someone else’s data, you increase the potential for new ideas and interesting collaborations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can use Google to look for data sets but bear in mind that you will miss any that are not indexed by the search engine because it may be only visible to registered site users or because the pages containing the data have been set to block the search engine’s indexing tool. If you decide to go this route, it is especially important that you are clear on what you are looking for before you start searching, or you may end up spending a lot of time scrolling through irrelevant sets and pages.</p>

  <p>Ask yourself at least the following questions when you start looking for data:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>What is the scope? Geographic boundaries, specific data attributes (e.g., age range), and timeframes can all help narrow down your search for the right data set.</li>
    <li>What type of data are you looking for? Do you need statistics, research data or system generated data (e.g., logs)? Do you need access to raw data? Are you looking for data that has been collected using a specific method?</li>
    <li>How should this data set contribute to your existing data analysis? Do you need several external data sets to complete your analysis?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>In addition to using a search engine, directories of repositories make it easier to find something specific to your research needs (examples are re3data.org, DataBib, DataCite, Dryad). Commercial sites such as Amazon Web Services will also compile and make available data repositories. DataCatalogs.org and Open Access Directory maintain current lists of open data repositories.</p>

  <p>The open content and access movement has gained traction on the Internet over the last few years, and many institutions, governments and organizations have established policies to encourage and support the release of data to the public as part of their plan to provide more transparency and accountability and to encourage the proliferation of new services and products.</p>

  <p>Open data repositories benefit both the contributors and the users by providing an online forum to share and brainstorm new ways to study and discuss data. In some cases, data crowdsourcing has led to new findings that otherwise would have developed at a much slower rate or would have not been possible in the first place. One of the more publicized crowdsourcing projects is Foldit from the University of Washington, a Web-based puzzle game that allows anyone to submit protein folding variations which are used by scientists to build new innovative solutions in bioinformatics and medicine. And recently, according to a February 2014 article on ecancer News, Cancer Research UK released a mobile game that tasks users with identifying cancer cells in biopsy slides which in turns helps researchers cut down data analysis time.</p>

  <p>Many governments now have a web portal specifically for their collection of open data sets. For instance, Kenya’s Open Data Initiative began in 2011 with the goal to make key government data available to the public. International bodies such as the World Bank and United Nations also have founded their own open data sites. Open Data Index and Open Data Barometer are two sites that track public government data around the world to provide details on the policies and data that have been released.</p>

  <p>Research institutions and corporations make many of their data sets available to other researchers. If you want to get an overview of the data available in a given subject area, associations and academic institutions will provide a list of data sets relevant to their areas of study (e.g.,  http://www.apa.org/research/responsible/data-links.aspx). A new site offering academic papers and data using P2P (peer to peer) technology is Academic Torrents, developed by two computer science PhD students from the University of Massachusetts Boston.</p>

  <p>Finally, a more informal way to locate public data is to browse and search the data available in web-based visualization tools. Knoema, IBM Many Eyes, Google Public Data Explorer, Gapminder and other data visualization sites encourage users to upload their data sets which then makes the data sets and visualizations available to others. So if you are not familiar with  or need ideas on what you can do with a particular type of data, consider browsing these online data visualization tools for inspirations. Or attend and participate communal events such as the annual Open Data Day to see what others have done with open data.</p>

  <h2>Non-Public Data</h2>

  <p>There are times that you may have access to special collections data because of your status within a particular network or through an existing relationship. Or you are interested in the raw data from a free data summary (e.g., market research data) and have the option to purchase the data set at a cost. In either case you typically have to agree to and sign a license to obtain the data, so always make sure that you obtain a copy of the Terms of Use and review its contents prior to your purchase. If no terms are provided, insist on getting a permission to use the data set in writing. </p>

  <h2>Assessing External Data</h2>

  <p>Let’s say that you have found a data set that fits your criteria. But is the quality good enough?</p>

  <p>Assessing data quality means looking at all the details provided about the data (including metadata) and the context in which the data is presented. Good data sets will provides this information along with the data. For online data sets, this often means “more information” or “about” web pages or a link to documentation with details about the data set’s purpose, ownership, methods, scope, dates and any other notes.</p>

  <p>When you review the data to decide whether you want to use it or not, watch out for the following red flags:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>No data collection method has been stated or there no details have been included.</li>
    <li>There is no contact information.</li>
    <li>Ownership of the data is unclear.</li>
    <li>No authoritative entities or credentials are associated with the data collector or data.</li>
    <li>The terms of use or license includes details that raises questions about the information about the data or the data set itself.  For instance, the terms might explicitly instruct that the data not be used for scientific study.</li>
    <li>Metadata is inconsistent or missing.</li>
    <li>Large chunks of data is missing without explanation or reference points.</li>
    <li>The raw data looks “too perfect”. Although there are no clear guidelines for this, it is something that subject experts can often spot.</li>
    <li>There are published articles challenging or questioning the data set.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are many aspects that you can take into consideration when reviewing the data for your use. If you are concerned that you may miss something during your assessment, try to draw on general information evaluation techniques. For instance, one popular method used by academic libraries when teaching students to evaluate information is the CRAAP test, which consists of a set of questions that help you determine the quality of a text. The acronym stands for:</p> 

  <table class="tableizer-table sections">
    <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
      <td>Currency</td>
      <td>Is the information up-to-date? When was it collected / published / updated?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Relevancy</td>
      <td>Is the information suitable for your intended use? Does it address your research question? Is there other (better) information?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Authority</td>
      <td>Is the information creator reputable and has the necessary credentials? Can you trust the information?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accuracy</td>
      <td>Do you spot any errors? What is the source of the information? Can other data or research support this information?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Purpose</td>
      <td>What was the intended purpose of the information collected? Are other potential uses identified?</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Using External Data</h2>

  <p>So now you have a data set that meets your criteria and you have the permission to use it. What else should you do before you start your work?</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Make sure you obtain all the necessary details about the data, such as variable specifications, codebook, external data dictionaries or reference works.</li>
    <li>Is this data part of a bigger set of data / research? If yes, look for any specifications or notes from the bigger data set that may apply to this data.</li>
    <li>Find out if the data has been used before. Is your analysis adding any new insights about the data or are you simply repeating something that has already been done?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Answers to these questions could affect the way you utilize the data by changing the scope of your analysis or prompting you to look for additional data. They may even cause you to throw out your original research question. </p>

  <p>Before you begin your analysis, remember to document your process and use of the data, including noting down administrative details such as licensing rights, communication with the data owners, data storage and retention. This is be helpful when you wish to recreate your analysis or need to retrace your activities at a later time. If you intend to share your results or findings in the future, do not forget to include any additional products (codebook, additional data sources) that result from your analytical tasks. Your careful documentation will provide evidence to other researchers that your analysis was conducted properly and allow them to build on your data findings.</p>

  <h2>Giving Credit to External Data Sources </h2>

  <p>Crediting the source of your external data set is a critical aspect of your work. Not only is it the morally right thing to do, but ethical research guidelines state that crediting sources is mandatory for any type of research. So always make sure that you give sufficient credit to any external data that you use by providing citations. </p>

  <p>The goal of citing is to provide the reader with enough information to find the data that you have accessed and used. Cite your data sources using existing citation style manuals (APA, MLA, Chicago, Turabian, Harvard). Unlike published items such as articles or books, citing a data set varies a great deal from style to style.</p>

  <p>As a general rule all styles require the author and title. In addition, editors, producer or distributor information (location and publication date), access date (which is the date when you first viewed the data), details about the data set (e.g., unique identifier, edition and material type) and the URL may be needed. For government data sets, use the name of the department, committee or agency as the group / corporate author. </p>

  <p>For example, the <em>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</em>, 6th edition, (APA style manual in short) cites census data the following way:</p>

  <blockquote>U.S. Bureau of the Census. (2013). Annual Survey of Public Employment and Payroll,<br />
    2012 [Data File]. Retrieved from <br />
    <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/annual-survey-of-public-employment-and-payrol" target="_blank">http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/annual-survey-of-public-employment-and-payrol</a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>while the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Paper, 7th edition, (MLA style manual in short) cites the same census data as:</p>

  <blockquote>U.S. Bureau of the Census. Annual Survey of Public Employment and Payroll, 2012. <br />
    Web. March 7 2014.
  </blockquote>

  <p>In many instances data repositories and organizations have their own citation guidelines and provide ready citations that you can use “as is”. The Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), The National Centre for Health Statistics, Dryad, PANGAEA and Roper Center Data all provide guidelines for citing their data sets.</p>
