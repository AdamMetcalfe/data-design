    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <h1>Intro to Survey Design</h1>
  </hgroup>

  <section data-type="sect1">

  <p>So you want to collect some data about a topic that interests you and you have decided the best way to do that is to conduct a survey. Most people think that creating a survey is as simple as writing a bunch of questions and then asking people to answer them. Easy, right? However, survey design is a bit more complicated than that, especially if you want to be sure to collect the best data possible. Don’t worry! In the next chapter, we will go over a few key elements to help you get started.</p>

    <h1 class="chapter-font-color">Purpose of a Survey</h1>

    <p>A well-formulated survey should allow you to collect accurate and verifiable data about your topic of interest so you can make factual rather than speculative claims. To achieve this goal, it is important to clearly identify the purpose(s) of your survey before creating it so you know what information you need to obtain from your respondents.</p>

    <p>Let’s say that you are a rich media tycoon who is trying to improve his or her television viewing profits. You want to know how many people are watching their favorite programs on cable T.V to opposed to on the Internet. The main questions and purposes of your survey are:</p>

    <table class="tableizer-table question-and-answer">
      <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
        <th>Research Question</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><em>What percentage of television viewers watch their favorite tv shows on cable television to opposed to watching it online?</em></td>
        <td><h2>Describe a variable</h2><p>The number of people likely to watch television programs online versus on cable TV.</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>After thinking about it, you realize that it would be beneficial to get some more details, so you add a few purposes to your survey:</p>

    <table class="tableizer-table question-and-answer">
      <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
        <th>Research Question</th>
        <th>Purpose</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td><em>Do younger television users tend to stream more television programs online than older viewers?</em></td>
        <td>
          <h2>Describe a relationship between variables</h2>
          <p>Which age group is more likely to watch television programs online?</p>
        </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><em>Why do older television viewers watch more television programs on cable TV than on the Internet?</em></td>
       <td>
         <h2>Explain a relationship</h2>
         <p>What makes older viewers prefer one option to the other?</p>
       </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><em>How can we make online viewership profitable?</em></td>
       <td>
         <h2>Influence something</h2>
         <p>What do we need to do to change things?</p>
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
    
    <p>Here are a few questions to ask yourself as you are refining the purpose of your survey:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What are you trying to achieve with this survey?</li>
      <li>What do you want to know precisely?</li>
      <li>Why is this important to know?</li>
      <li>Is there other information that could be useful? Why?</li>
      <li>Is conducting a survey the right method?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div data-type="note">
      <img src="../images/shared-icons/warning.png" alt="warning" />
      <p>Data and numbers can be very powerful. Sometimes people conduct surveys for the wrong reasons. You will miss the opportunity to gain serious insight or obtain meaningful information with your survey if:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You don’t  really care about the results. You just want to show people that you’ve got numbers.</li>
        <li>You misuse the data collected.</li>
        <li>You are more concerned about how people will receive your findings than having reliable results.</li>
        <li>You have already determined what the results should be.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>The purpose of doing research is to gain insight and confirm or disconfirm a hypothesis. Surveys will help you reach these goals. To have a genuine impact with with your data, it is important to try and collect the most accurate and representative data possible.</p>

    <h2>Self-Administered and Administered Surveys</h2>

    <p>Before discussing different types of surveys, it is important to understand the difference between a self-administered and administered survey. Self-administered simply means that respondents fill out the questionnaire by themselves. A good example would be an online survey or e-mail/mail survey. These are useful for those with limited budgets and who wish to have large geographic reach.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, self-administered surveys are limited to those who can read and write. So this may not be the best option, if your target audience is blind or illiterate, for example. There is also a higher risk of respondents misinterpreting questions since there is no one administering the survey. These types of surveys can also lead to some sampling biases (e.g. online surveys favor a tech savvy population) and cannot prevent a person to answer the questionnaire in someone else’s name.</p>

    <table class="tableizer-table pros-and-cons">
      <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
        <th>Pros</th>
        <th>Cons</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Good for limited budgets</li>
            <li>Large geographic reach</li>
            <li>Respondents can answer on their own time</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Limited to people who know how to read and write</li>
            <li>Risk of respondents misinterpreting questions</li>
            <li>Risk of lower completion rate</li>
            <li>Lead to some sampling biases (e.g. online surveys may favor a tech savvy population)</li>
            <li>Cannot verify that the respondent was actually the person who completed the survey (puts the survey’s validity in question)</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Administered surveys mean that there is a person (interviewer) who asks questions to respondents. These are usually conducted either by phone or through face-to-face interviews. They  offer better quality control and the possibility to collect more in-depth information with interviewers who can clarify questions or probe respondents for more details. However, administered surveys are often more expensive than self-administered surveys and can be more time consuming, if we take into consideration the time needed to train interviewers and collect more exhaustive data. There is also the risk of interviewers’ effect, where interrogators might bias responses through their interactions with the respondent (e.g. the way that they ask a question, adding additional and unnecessary explanations to a question, etc.)</p>

      <table class="tableizer-table pros-and-cons">
        <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
          <th>Pros</th>
          <th>Cons</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Better quality control</td>
          <td>Very expensive</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Interviewers can clarify questions for respondents</td>
          <td>Time consuming</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Collects richer and more in-depth information</td>
          <td>Risk of interviewers' effect (ex: an interviewer’s interpretation of a question could biases some of the results)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Easier to reach specific or marginalized populations (ex: the elderly or the homeless)</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>One of the easiest and quickest ways to conduct a survey is online.</td>
          <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
          
    <h2>Online and email surveys</h2>

    <p>Today, one of the easiest and quickest ways to conduct a survey is online. The two most common ways of doing this are 1) directing respondents to a website where the questionnaire resides and 2) sending the questionnaire via e-mail in an embedded or attached format.</p>

    <p>The website option is useful if you want to integrate graphs, images and sound files into your questionnaire. You can also easily redirect participants to your survey with a link through social media tools such as Twitter or Facebook. There are many online surveying platforms that allow you to create your own questionnaires online and analyze responses in real-time at an affordable rate. Some services are even free for a limited number of questions and responses. More and more platforms even offer mobile versions of your survey.</p>

    <p>Simply search for <em>online survey</em> tools on the Internet, and you will find many options at your disposal. Just be aware that these platforms are often subject to the laws of the country in which they are based. If you are dealing with sensitive data, be sure to read the Privacy Policies and Terms of Use before signing up.</p>

    <table class="tableizer-table pros-and-cons">
      <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
        <th>Pros</th>
        <th>Cons</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fairly fast results</td>
        <td>Limited to only people who use or have access to the web.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Integration of support tools (ex: images, sounds, video)</td>
        <td>Sample can be self-selective</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Relatively cheap method</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Email surveys can be harder to disseminate since you need people’s email addresses to be able to send the survey. You must also take into consideration technical issues such as, will everyone be able to open and fill out your attachment? Email surveys are, however, useful when you want to target a group of people you already know, such as your clients or a group of company employees.</p>

    <p>The one major pitfall of online and email surveys is that you are limiting answers only to people who have access to the Internet. Since they are self-administered, this means that your sample will be self-selected, creating a bias in your sample.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, almost all survey methods have biases. The extent of this bias varies depending on the survey type you use and the question you are trying to answer. Here’s an example:</p>

    <table class="tableizer-table pros-and-cons">
      <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
        <th>Yes</th>
        <th>No</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Example: We want to know if Internet users view more television shows on cable TV or online.</td>
        <td>Example: We want to know if people in general watch more television shows on cable TV or on the Internet.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>In this case, online surveys are a good option when we want to examine an online population. They are a bad option when we want to know about a whole population because we’d be excluding all those who do not have access to the Internet or who have a poor and unreliable Internet connection.</p>

    <h2>Mail surveys</h2>

    <p>Mail surveys are much like e-mail surveys since they are self-administered, except that you are sending a paper version of the questionnaire by mail. The advantages and the disadvantages are more or less equivalent, except you must take into consideration the costs of printing, paper, envelopes and stamps. Don’t forget to include a pre-addressed envelope with pre-paid postage when sending the survey or you risk reducing your completion rate.</p>

    <h2>Phone surveys</h2>

    <p>Phones surveys are administered surveys, so they are more costly. However, they ensure higher quality control and are more adaptable since a trained survey taker will guide respondents through the questions and clarify any misunderstandings. The data collection period for phone surveys are often shorter than mail or e-mail surveys since respondents are immediately called upon to answer the survey when contacted. </p>

    <table class="tableizer-table pros-and-cons">
      <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
        <th>Pros</th>
        <th>Cons</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Relatively fast results</td>
        <td>Higher costs</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The disadvantages are that the survey cannot be too long (no more than 15-20 mins) if you are cold-calling respondents. Questions must be short and concise. Interviewers cannot see respondents so they may not pick up on non-verbal cues and cannot use visual props to help ask questions.</p>

    <p>You also need to have an up-to-date phone number list and may need an expert to help randomize your sample. Although it is possible to use a random number generator, you still need to have a basic understanding of random sampling theory to reduce sampling errors.  You will also have to watch out for interviewer effects[1] in order to reduce biases in your survey.</p>

    <table class="tableizer-table pros-and-cons">
      <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
        <th>Yes</th>
        <th>No</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Example: We want to know what people think about the name of our new television station.</td>
        <td>Example: We want to know whether people think our new logo is appropriate to our brand message.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>In the above example, a phone survey would be a good option because you could reach a large and general population. However, it is not very useful in the second situation because the respondents would not be able to directly see the logo options you are considering, making it difficult for them to make a good choice.</p>

    <h2>Face-to-face surveys</h2>

    <p>Face-to-face surveys share many of the same advantages, disadvantages and biases as phone surveys. The one major difference is that they also have geographic limitations because the interviewer has to sit down with the interviewee. However, they are really useful when you want to collect data from a very specific and hard-to-reach population, or when you want to conduct a very long survey (such as a census).</p>

    <table class="tableizer-table pros-and-cons">
      <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
        <th>Pros</th>
        <th>Cons</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gets more in-depth information</td>
        <td>Expensive cost</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Useful to reach specific and hard to reach populations</td>
        <td>Interviewers effects</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Takes a long time</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Let’s review our previous examples of watching television shows on TV or the Internet. Say we wanted to know the following details:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>How do families watch television programs in their homes?</li>
      <li>Which family members tend to watch TV online?</li>
      <li>What type of television program does each family member like to watch?</li>
      <li>Do they watch programs together?</li>
      <li>If so, what types of programs do they watch together? Do they ever fight about what to watch?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this case, face-to-face surveys would allow you to interview all the members of a single household at the same time, enabling you to get more details on the dynamics of television watching in family households.</p>

    <h1>Things to think about when choosing your survey type</h1>

    <p>As you can see, there are many types of surveys from which to choose. Each one has its pros, cons and biases. The decision to use one type over another all depends on a number of factors. When deciding which one to use, keep a few things in mind:</p>

    
    <div data-type="note">
      <ul>
        <li><em>Sample limitations:</em> Whom are you trying to reach? People that are only online? People that are only offline? Both?</li>
        <li><em>Budget:</em> How much money do you have to conduct the survey? Some options are less expensive than others.</li>
        <li><em>Speed:</em> What is the timeframe of your project? Do you need your data in the next week, month, year?</li>
        <li><em>Timing:</em> When do you plan to conduct your survey? The purpose of your survey will define when are the best and worst times to go out on the field. For example, if you wanted to know how much university students spent on school supplies during the year, you probably wouldn’t conduct your survey around the holiday seasons or summer months. Yet, if you wanted to know how much university students spent on travelling while on vacation, then this would be a good time to conduct your survey.</li>
        <li><em>Level of detail:</em> How in-depth do you want your data to be? Certain types of surveys are better suited for asking numerous or detailed questions than others.</li>
        <li><em>Number of respondents:</em> Some survey topics need a large group of respondents in order for it be representative, others not so much. It is important that the survey type you choose can affect response rates. Make sure that it meets your survey goals. For example, you risk reducing response rates if you use an online survey to target seniors or if you use mail surveys to target young people online under 18 years old.</li>
        <li><em>Mixing it up:</em> If you have the time and resources to do so, consider using more than one type of survey. For example, you may want to do an online and mail version of a same survey to increase respondent rates and improve your sample. Or you may start by doing an online survey and then conduct a face-to-face survey afterwards to gain more insight from your online results.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Designing your questionnnaire</h2>

    <p>When you have identified the purpose of your survey and chosen which type you will use, the next step is to actually design the questionnaire itself. In this section, we will look at the structure, layout and ordering of questions. We will also talk about a few key things to keep in mind once you are done designing your questionnaire.</p>

    <h3>Questionnaire structure</h3>

    <p>Do you remember when you were taught in grade school that every essay should have an introduction, body and conclusion? Questionnaires, like school essays, should have a certain structure. Here is how to build a questionnaire:</p>


    <table class="tableizer-table sections">
      <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
        <th>Section</th>
        <th>What to include:</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Introduction</td>
        <td>
          <h2>Always start your survey with a brief introduction which explains:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>the purpose of the survey</li>
            <li>who is conducting it</li>
            <li>the voluntary nature of the participant’s invovlvement</li>
            <li>the respect of confidentiality</li>
            <li>time required to complete the survey</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Main topic</td>
        <td>
          <h2>Generally, it is best to start with easy questions and then move on to harder, or more specific questions.</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask about objective facts before asking more subjective questions.</li>
            <li>Order questions from the most familiar to least.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the answer for a question does not diminish the impact of the next one. There should be logic in the order.</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Transition between topics</td>
        <td>
          <h2>To reduce boredom or lost of interest, use transitions between groups of questions to explain a new topic or format. For example:</h2>
          <p>“The next few questions are related to the frequency of your TV viewing habits. Please choose the answer that best describes your situation.”</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Demographic questions</td>
        <td>
          <h2>It is usually best to place demographic questions near the end of a survey, when people begin to get tired and start losing their focus. Typical demographic questions include:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Gender</li>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Income</li>
            <li>Nationality or Location</li>
            <li>Education</li>
            <li>Civil status</li>
            <li>Cultural background</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Conclusion</td>
        <td>
          <h2>Thank the participant for their contribution and explain how it has been valuable to the project. Reiterate that their identity will be kept confidential and that results will be anonymized. If you wish, you can also include:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Your contact information in case they have any additional questions related to the survey.</li>
            <li>Ask for their contact information if you are offering an incentive for completing the survey.</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    

    <p>Sometimes you might contact respondents ahead of time and invite them to participate in the survey. In addition to including the same information you would find in your survey introduction, you should also explain why they have been selected to participate, when the survey will take place and how they may access it.</p>

    <h2>General layout</h2>

    <p>Although some survey types may have certain layout specificity, there are a few good rules to follow when designing the general layout of your survey.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Put your introduction and conclusion on separate pages from your questions.</li>
      <li>The format should be easy to follow and understand.</li>
      <li>Check that filter questions work as intended (see Dichotomous Questions for more information).</li>
      <li>In general, response rates tend to diminish as surveys become longer. Stick to questions that meet your goals, rather than just asking questions you think might be important.</li>
      <li>Leave enough space for respondents to answer open-ended questions.</li>
      <li>Make sure to include all likely answers for closed-ended questions, including an “other” option in case respondents feel that none of the provided answers suite them.</li>
      <li>Ensure that questions flow well and follow a certain sequence of logic. Begin the survey with more general questions and then follow with more specific or harder issues. Finish with general demographic topics (e.g. age, gender, etc.) Group questions by theme or topic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A few more things to keep in mind...</h2>

    <h3>Sampling</h3>

    <p>Sampling is very important especially when it would be impossible to survey a large population. A sample is a subset of a population. Unfortunately, there is too much to cover on the subject so we won’t go into great detail here. However, any time you want to make predictions or inference (also known as inferential statistics) with the data you collect you must make sure to use a sampling technique before going out in the field.</p>

    <p>For more details on sampling, check out one of these sites:</p>

    <p>[add links?]</p>

    <h3>Consider your audience</h3>

    <p>Think about the people who will be participating in your survey. Let’s say that you want to do a survey in a school where many students have recently immigrated to the country as refugees with their families, and don’t speak the local language very well. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In what language(s) should you conduct the survey? Should you only conduct the survey in the local language or instead prepare the survey in several languages to get better results?</li>
      <li>What kind of vocabulary should you use? These are students, not university professors. You will probably want to use fairly basic language, especially if many are not native speakers. We have not specified their age, but it would also be useful to take this information into consideration when thinking about vocabulary.</li>
      <li>Is the use of certain colors, font or images appropriate or useful? In this case, images and fun fonts are probably very practical to engage with a young  target audience. However, it is important to consider cultural sensitivities. Certain images or use of colors could evoke negative thoughts or sentiments in people, especially from children who have suffered from traumatic events or who come from war-torn countries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Give clear instructions</h3>

    <p>It is important that your instructions and questions are simple and coherent. Remember: you want to make sure that everyone understands and interprets the survey in the same way.</p>

    <h3>Pay attention to length</h3>

    <p>We often want to collect as much information as possible when conducting a survey. However, extremely long surveys become tedious to answer and decreases the response rate. Participants get tired or bored. After a while, you risk getting false answers from people who are trying to finish the survey as rapidly as possible. When reviewing your questionnaire, ask yourself: do I really need this question? Will it bring any valuable data that can contribute to my reason for doing this survey?</p>

    <h3>Track progress</h3>

    <p>It is good to indicate the respondent’s progress as they advance through the survey. It gives them an idea of their progression and encourages them to continue on. In a self-administered survey, a progress bar such as the one below could be placed at the beginning of each new section or transition.</p>

    <figure>[Image goes here]</figure>

    <p>In an administered survey, the interviewer can simply make statements such as:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“We are halfway done.”</p>
      <p>“There are only two more sections left.”</p>
      <p>“Only a few more questions to answer.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Train interviewers</h3>

    <p>If you are conducting an administered survey, you will have to prepare your interviewers ahead of time, explaining their tasks, and making sure that they understand all the questions properly. You will probably want to supervise them while conducting the survey in the beginning to monitor quality control and interviewer effects.</p>

    <h3>Pre-testing</h3>

    <p>Pre-testing means testing your survey with a few initial respondents before officially going out on the field. This allows you to get instant feedback and improve any issues you might have with length, technical issues, question ordering and wording, etc. Sometimes we skip this step because we have a tight deadline to meet. But don’t underestimate the value of pre-testing. In the end you can save a lot time and money.</p>

    <h3>Anonymize responses</h3>

    <p>We quickly touched on response anonymization in Questionnaire structure. It is very important to anonymize responses and let participants know you are doing so for one simple reason: Trust.</p>

    <p>You want your participants to trust you enough to answer truthfully. Sometimes, people are afraid to give an honest response for fear that it might be traced back to them. By anonymizing responses you will get more accurate data while protecting the identity of your participants.</p>

    <h3>Anticipate coding</h3>

    <p>We talk more about coding later on in the book. But just remember that you can already start thinking how you will code your answers when designing your questionnaire. This can save you some headaches later on.</p>

    <h3>Incentives</h3>

    <p>The use of incentives can be contentious. On one hand, you want to encourage as many people as possible to participant in your survey. On the other hand, you do not want to induce biases in your data. In other words, you do not want people to give arbitrary answer just to complete the survey and receive a prize.</p>

    <p>If the survey is very long and time consuming, maybe consider giving a small reward or stipend for each completed questionnaire. If the survey is shorter, maybe consider doing a draw with eligible participants (ex: participants who have completed the survey and have given their contact information in order to be part of the draw).

    <h1>Questions</h1>

    <h2>Types of questions</h2>

    <p>Once you have chosen the type of survey you will conduct, you will have to start thinking about the types of questions you will use. There are all sorts of questions that you can employ. It all depends of course on what type of data you are looking to collect.</p>

    <h3>Open versus Closed questions (collecting qualitative versus quantitative data)</h3>

    <p>Open or open-ended questions are used when you want to collect qualitative data. These are normally employed when you want to get more details on a specific area. This means you ask the person a question without offering any specific answers from which to choose. This is often a good option to discover new aspects, reasons or phenomena you may have overlooked or did not know existed.</p>

    <p>Closed questions are just the opposite. Numerous answers are offered when asking the question. Closed questions are used when we want to measure something in a very specific way and we want to collect quantitative data.</p>

    <p>Let’s look at a new example. Pretend that you work for an ice cream parlour called Fictionals (yes, we made up the name). You want to know why some people do not go and buy ice cream at your store.  Here is how you could ask an open and closed question.</p>

    <figure>[Image goes here]</figure>

    <p>In the closed question, we offer the most probable reasons why people would not go eat ice cream at our store. However, you will notice that when we ask an open-ended question we gain new insight on why some people might not try our ice cream: it’s not because they don’t like ice cream or they don’t like us (or our product), it’s because they can’t eat it! With this new insight, Fictionals is able to offer a new type of ice cream and attract a clientele it once did not have.</p>

    <p>As you can see, there are advantages to asking open-ended questions. The problem is that it is tedious work to code qualitative data, even with the help of a computer program or application. When you think that most people will probably give more or less the same answers, you can combine an open and closed question to get the best results. Here is how the same question would look if you transformed it into a combined open and closed question:</p>

    <h3>Dichotomous questions</h3>

    <p>Dichotomous questions are when there only two possible answers are given to a question. Here are some classic examples of dichotomous type questions:</p>

    <figure>[Image goes here]</figure>

    <p><strong>Be aware!</strong>  A large sequence of dichotomous questions (ex. true or false) in a survey can bore respondents, causing them to give random answers in order to finish sooner. Try to spread them out throughout your survey if you must use many.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you will use dichotomous questions to determine if a respondent is suited to respond to a next question. This is called a filter or contingency question. Filters can get very complex, so try to limit the number of filter questions you use to two or three. Here’s an example:</p>

    <figure>[Image goes here]</figure>

    <h3>Multiple choice questions</h3>

    <p>Anyone who has ever passed an exam has probably already answered a multiple-choice question. Sometimes in surveys we want the respondent to choose only one among several answers. In this case, we use <em>radio</em> buttons (or circles), which indicate to only choose one item. When we want the respondent to choose more than one option, we use a <em>checkbox</em> instead. Here is what it looks like in practice:</p>

    <figure>[Image goes here]</figure>

    <h3>Scaled questions</h3>

    <p>Scaled questions are used to measure people’s attitudes, opinions, lifestyles and environments. There are many different types but the most commonly used are Likert[1]
    and sliding scales. The main difference between the two is that a Likert scale uses text categories while a sliding scale uses numbers.</p>

    <figure>[Image goes here]</figure>

    <p>In the example above, the same question is asked twice, once with a Likert scale and once with a sliding scale. Notice that in the Likert scale there are five categories while in the sliding scale there are seven. Normally in a scaled question we either use 5, 7 or 10-point scales.</p>

    <p>These are odd number scales that allow participants to agree, disagree or indicate their neutrality (a 10-point scale includes 0, making it an odd number scale). An even number scale, such as a 4 or 6-point scale,  only allows participants to agree or disagree. This is why the odd number scales are usually preferred, although there are times when you might want to to use an even number scale if you consider that there is no room for “neutrality” in the question or you want to obligate the respondent to choose one or the other. This is what we call a “forced question”.</p>

    <h3>Likert scale</h3>

    <p>Likert scales are usually limited to a five-category scale. This is because it is difficult to create a greater number of categories using text. The most common  Likert scales your will find are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><em>Opinions and attitudes:</em> “How much do you agree with…?”</p>
        <p>Possible answers: Strongly agree, agree, neither agree or disagree, disagree, strongly disagree.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Frequency:</em> “How often do you…?”</p>
        <p>Possible answers: Always, often, sometimes, rarely, never.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Quality:</em> “In general, how do you rate the quality of…?”</p>
        <p>Possible answers: Excellent, very good, good, fair, poor.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Importance:</em> “How important would you say {topic} is…”</p>
        <p>Possible answers: Very important, important, somewhat important, not at all important.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sliding scale</h2>

    <p>A sliding scale is useful when you want to have a more accurate reading of the respondent’s answer and is most beneficial in an online survey. Some people think that sliding scales are better than Likert scales because they are more interactive for respondents, but this is specifically in an online context. Sliding scales are extremely practical when conducting a multi-lingual survey, as text categories are not always very easy to translate.</p>

    <figure>[Image goes here]</figure>

    <p><strong>Be aware!</strong> When creating a sliding scale, never forget to label the first and last points in your scale. Otherwise, your respondents may misinterpret your scale, creating errors in your data.</p>

    <h2>Question wording</h2>

    <p>It is extremely important to think about how you word your questions when developing your survey. Here are a few key things to keep in mind:</p>

    <h3>Focus</h3>

    <p>Each question should be specific and only have one focus.</p>

    <blockquote>Do: How many times have you eaten ice cream in the last month?</blockquote>

    <p>This question focuses on one issue (frequency of ice cream eating) and is specific (a certain time period).</p>

    <blockquote>Don’t: Do you avoid eating ice cream because you are on a diet? [Answer: Yes, I
      avoid ice cream, but not because I am on a diet]</blockquote>

    <p>This question is bad because it focuses on two different issues. You should not use the word “and” if it is connecting two different ideas. Instead, you could use filter questions to obtain the desired information. For example:</p>

    <figure>[Image goes here]</figure>

    <h3>Precision</h3>

    <p>Not everyone will interpret all words in the same way, even if they are simple. You can define terms with a lead-in built into the question. Try to reduce ambiguity and the use of double negatives.</p>

    <table class="tableizer-table">
      <tr class="tableizer-firstrow">
        <th>Do</th>
        <th>Don’t</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Rocky Road, Mint Chocolate Chip, Dutch Chocolate and Hot Fudge ice creams are Fictionals’ best sellers. Have you eaten any chocolate ice cream in the last month?</td>
        <td>Have you eaten chocolate ice cream in the past month?</td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ice cream with peanuts should be banned.</td>
        <td>Ice cream with peanuts should not be permitted.</td></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ice cream vendors should accept to have a peanut-free shop.</td>
        <td>Ice cream vendors should not disclaim having a peanut-free shop.</td></tr>
    </table>
    

    <h3>Brevity</h3>

    <p>Your questions should be relatively short, except where additional wording is necessary to provide context or to clarify terminology.</p>

    <blockquote>Do: Please list your three favorite ice creams in order of preference.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Don’t: Can you please tell us what ice cream flavors you like and what are
      your first, second and third favorite?</blockquote>

    <h3>Biased and leading questions</h3>

    <p>Biased or leading questions can easily skew your answers if you do not pay close attention to how you use words, especially strong ones. Avoid overemphasizing statements and keep an eye out for questions that create “social desirability effects” where people will answer according to what society views as “proper” or a desirable behavior.</p>

    <blockquote>Do: Do you agree that all ice cream vendors in our city should offer peanut-free products?</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Don’t: Do you agree that ice cream vendors that serve peanuts are a severe hazard for the well-being of our children?</blockquote>

    <p>Notice how the second question tries to bias the respondent by using strong or affective words such as “severe”, “hazard”, “well-being”, and “children”. Even the first one is a bit leading with the use of the word “all”. The better question would be:</p>

    <blockquote>Do you agree that ice cream vendors in our city should offer peanut-free products?</blockquote>

    <h3>A few final things...</h3>

    <p>Finally, there are few last things to consider when developing your survey questions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Be sure to vary the type of questions you use to keep your respondents engaged throughout the whole survey. Remember, don’t just use one type question (eg. true/false questions). You have a variety to choose from. So mix it up while keeping in mind that each type of question has a specific purpose.</li>
      <li>Also include a “Don’t know” or “Not applicable” option among your answers when it makes sense (usually in your multiple choice and yes-no questions). You will have more precise results and may actually come across some unexpected insight.</li>
      <li>Think about how certain words can have different interpretations and remember that meanings are often embedded in culture and language. Be sensitive to different cultures if you are examining several groups within a population.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>As you have noticed, there are many things to plan and reflect upon when designing a survey. We’ve only presented a very broad overview of survey design. You can find much more information online or at the library.</p>
      <p>It can seem long and daunting at first, but just remember that this is will be the foundation of your data analysis. If you get this step right, you will collect much better data and make the rest of your work much easier! Good luck!</p>
