    <h1>Additional Data Collection Methods</h1>
  </header>

  <section data-type="sect1">

<p>Not all types of information are easily gathered using surveys.  Surveys are self-report tools that take place at a single point in time, so exact measurements, external impressions of reactions, and data about things that happen over time can be difficult to capture, but these are important pieces of information that you may need.  Let’s discuss a few of the other data collection tools you can use to better collect these types of data.    </p>

<h2>Direct Measurement</h2>

<p>Everyone has lied about their weight at some point.   Whether someone asked you about it verbally or you were filling out a form, you gave a number you knew wasn’t right.  There are several reasons you might have done this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Social expectation: you felt there was an answer you were supposed to give; you knew the actual answer was higher or lower than the answer you felt was “correct” </li>
<li>Lack of information: you didn’t actually know how much you weighed when asked</li>
<li>Ease of response: you knew about how much you weighed but didn’t think the exact answer was important; “I’m about 170 lbs, so I’ll say that.” </li>  
</ul>

<p>There might be other reasons, too.  Whatever your thought process, the fact remains that the information you gave was inaccurate.  Whether it matters that the weight information in a data set is accurate depends on what the data are being used for.  If you have a variable like weight that is likely to be biased when self-reported and it is important that these data are correct, direct measurement should be used instead of a survey.   </p>

<p>In direct measurement, you use a device to take an actual measurement of a variable and then record the value in the data set.  This is often done for health-related variables that a person wouldn’t be able to just know.  The measurements are usually captured on forms and the data is transferred from the forms into the data set. </p>

<p>It is important for your forms to be clear about how you want the measurement to be recorded.  You should indicate the preferred units and the precision you want the measurement captured with.  One of the easiest ways to communicate this is by allotting a specific number of boxes so the person taking the measurement knows how many digits you want recorded. </p>

<p>The image below shows an example for how we might set up a form for capturing adult weight.  Here, we want the measurement in pounds, and we want the number recorded to two digits after the decimal place.</p>

<p>When relevant, include a place to record what device was used to take the measurement.  </p>

<h2>Focus Groups</h2>

<p>Sometimes it’s helpful to watch people while they’re responding to your questions, see their thought processes, and observe them interacting with others.  You may also have a wider variety of topics you would like to cover than would make sense for a survey or you might not be sure exactly what questions need to be asked yet.  Focus groups can help in all these situations.      </p>

<h2>Diaries</h2>

<p>If you had to recall right now the details of every meal you’ve had for the last month, could you do it with 100% accuracy?  Very few of us could.  Diary forms can be useful if you’re collecting data from people about things that are happening over extended periods of time.  They are particularly helpful if you need to record a lot of details that could easily be misremembered or forgotten.  </p>

<p>You might have seen something similar to this before:</p>

<p>Diary forms are often used for tracking things like meals, medications, or exercise but can be used for anything you want to record over time.  They can be paper forms or computerized, but should the same design principles as surveys.  Fields should be well-labeled and the instructions should be very clear about what information should be entered in each field</p>.
