<h1>Finding external data</h1>
</header>

<section data-type="sect1">
<p>Making and distributing a survey isn’t the only way to get data.  You can also use
 <a class="glossterm" target="_blank" href="glossary01.html#data-external">external data</a>- data that someone else collected.  Using external data offers several benefits:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Time / Cost</td>
		<td>Can decrease the work required to collect and prepare data for analysis</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Access</td>
		<td>May allow you to work with data that requires more resources to collect than you have, or data that you wouldn't otherwise have access to at all</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Community</td>
		<td>Promotes new ideas and interesting collaborations by connecting you to people who are interested in the same topic.</td>
	</tr>
</table>


<h2>Where to Find External Data</h2>
<p>All those benefits sound great!  So where do you find external data?  To help narrow your search, ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Scope</td>
		<td>What is the scope of the data you’re looking for?  What are the:
			<ul>
				<li>geographic boundaries?</li>
				<li>specific data attributes (such as age range)?</li>
				<li>time periods?</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Type</td>
		<td>What type of data are you looking for?  Do you need:
			<ul>
				<li>statistics?</li>
				<li>research data?</li>
				<li>raw data?</li>
				<li>data that has been collected using a specific method?</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Contribution</td>
		<td>How will the data contribute to your existing data analysis?<br />
Do you need several external data sets to complete your analysis?</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>Public Data</h3>
<p>Once you have a better idea of what you’re looking for in an external data set, you can start your search at one of the many public data sources available to you - thanks to the open content and access movement that has been gaining traction on the Internet.  Many institutions, governments and organizations have established policies that support the release of data to the public in order to provide more transparency and accountability and to encourage the development of new services and products.  Here’s a breakdown of public data sources:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Source</th>
		<th>Examples</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Search Engines</td>
		<td><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></td>

<p>If you decide to use a search engine (like Google) to look for data sets, keep in mind that you’ll only find things that are indexed by the search engine.  Sometimes a website (and the resource associated with it) will be visible only to registered users or be set to block the search engine, so these kinds of sites won’t turn up in your search result. Even still, the Internet is a big playground, so save yourself the headache of scrolling through lots of irrelevant search results by being clear and specific about what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure what to do with a particular type of data, try browsing through the <a href="www.informationisbeautifulawards.com">Information is Beautiful awards</a> for inspiration.  You can also attend events such as the annual <a href="http://opendataday.org/">Open Data Day</a> to see what others have done with open data.</p>

<p>Open data repositories benefit both the contributors and the users by providing an online forum to share and brainstorm new ways to study and discuss data. In some cases, data crowdsourcing has led to new findings that otherwise would have developed at a much slower rate or would have not been possible in the first place. One of the more publicized crowdsourcing projects is Foldit from the University of Washington, a Web-based puzzle game that allows anyone to submit protein folding variations which are used by scientists to build new innovative solutions in bioinformatics and medicine. And recently, according to a February 2014 article on ecancer News, Cancer Research UK released a mobile game that tasks users with identifying cancer cells in biopsy slides which in turns helps researchers cut down data analysis time.</p>
