<h1>Finding external data</h1>
</header>

<section data-type="sect1">
<p>Making and distributing a survey isn’t the only way to get data.  You can also use
 <a class="glossterm" target="_blank" href="glossary01.html#data-external">external data</a>- data that someone else collected.  Using external data offers several benefits:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Time / Cost</td>
		<td>Can decrease the work required to collect and prepare data for analysis</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Access</td>
		<td>May allow you to work with data that requires more resources to collect than you have, or data that you wouldn't otherwise have access to at all</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Community</td>
		<td>Promotes new ideas and interesting collaborations by connecting you to people who are interested in the same topic.</td>
	</tr>
</table>


<h2>Where to Find External Data</h2>
<p>All those benefits sound great!  So where do you find external data?  To help narrow your search, ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Scope</td>
		<td>What is the scope of the data you’re looking for?  What are the:
			<ul>
				<li>geographic boundaries?</li>
				<li>specific data attributes (such as age range)?</li>
				<li>time periods?</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Type</td>
		<td>What type of data are you looking for?  Do you need:
			<ul>
				<li>statistics?</li>
				<li>research data?</li>
				<li>raw data?</li>
				<li>data that has been collected using a specific method?</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Contribution</td>
		<td>How will the data contribute to your existing data analysis?
Do you need several external data sets to complete your analysis?</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>Public Data</h3>
<p>Once you have a better idea of what you’re looking for in an external data set, you can start your search at one of the many public data sources available to you - thanks to the open content and access movement that has been gaining traction on the Internet.  Many institutions, governments and organizations have established policies that support the release of data to the public in order to provide more transparency and accountability and to encourage the development of new services and products.  Here’s a breakdown of public data sources:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Source</th>
		<th>Examples</th>

	<tr>
		<td>Search Engines</td>

<p>If you decide to use a search engine (like Google) to look for data sets, keep in mind that you’ll only find things that are indexed by the search engine.  Sometimes a website (and the resource associated with it) will be visible only to registered users or be set to block the search engine, so these kinds of sites won’t turn up in your search result. Even still, the Internet is a big playground, so save yourself the headache of scrolling through lots of irrelevant search results by being clear and specific about what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure what to do with a particular type of data, try browsing through the <a href="www.informationisbeautifulawards.com">Information is Beautiful awards</a> for inspiration.  You can also attend events such as the annual <a href="http://opendataday.org/">Open Data Day</a> to see what others have done with open data.</p>

<p>Open data repositories benefit both the contributors and the users by providing an online forum to share and brainstorm new ways to study and discuss data. In some cases, data crowdsourcing has led to new findings that otherwise would have developed at a much slower rate or would have not been possible in the first place. One of the more publicized crowdsourcing projects is Foldit from the University of Washington, a Web-based puzzle game that allows anyone to submit protein folding variations which are used by scientists to build new innovative solutions in bioinformatics and medicine. And recently, according to a February 2014 article on ecancer News, Cancer Research UK released a mobile game that tasks users with identifying cancer cells in biopsy slides which in turns helps researchers cut down data analysis time.</p>


<h3>Non-Public Data</h3>

<p>Of course, not all data is public. There may come a time when you have access to a special collection of data because of your status within a particular network or through an existing relationship. Or maybe you come across a data set that you can buy.  In either case, you typically have to agree to and sign a license in order to get the data, so always make sure that you review the Terms of Use <em>before</em> you buy. If no terms are provided, insist on getting written permission to use the data set.</p>

<h2>Assessing External Data</h2>

<p>Let’s say you’ve found a data set that fits your criteria. But is the quality good enough?</p>

<p>Assessing data quality means looking at all the details provided about the data (including metadata, or "data about the data," such as time and date of creation) and the context in which the data is presented. Good data sets will provide details about the data set’s purpose, ownership, methods, scope, dates, and other notes. For online data sets, you can often find this information by navigating to the “About” or “More Information” web pages or by following a “Documentation” link.</p>

<p>Feel free to use general information evaluation techniques when reviewing data.  For instance, one popular method used by academic libraries is the CRAAP Test, which is a set of questions that help you determine the quality of a text. The acronym stands for:</p>


<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><b>C</b>urrency</td>
			<td>Is the information up-to-date? When was it collected / published / updated?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>R</b>elevancy</td>
			<td>Is the information suitable for your intended use? Does it address your research question? Is there other (better) information?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>A</b>uthority</td>
			<td>Is the information creator reputable and has the necessary credentials? Can you trust the information?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>A</b>ccuracy</td>
			<td>Do you spot any errors? What is the source of the information? Can other data or research support this information?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>P</b>urpose</td>
			<td>What was the intended purpose of the information collected? Are other potential uses identified?</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>



<p>Finally, when you review the data set and its details, watch out for the following red flags:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Details of data collection method not stated.</li>
	<li>No contact information.</li>
	<li>Unclear ownership of data.</li>
	<li>No authoritative entities or credentials associated with data collector or data.</li>
	<li>Terms of use or license includes details that raises questions.
(e.g. data can’t be used for scientific study)</li>
	<li>Inconsistent or missing metadata.</li>
	<li>Large chunks of missing data without explanation or reference points.</li>
	<li>Raw data looks “too perfect”.</li>
	<li>Published articles challenge or question the data set.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Using External Data</h2>

<p>So now you have a data set that meets your criteria and you have the permission to use it. What else should you do before you start your work?</p>

<ol>
	<li>Make sure you obtain all the necessary details about the data, such as variable specifications, codebook, external data dictionaries or reference works.</li>
	<li>Is this data part of a bigger set of data / research? If yes, look for any specifications or notes from the bigger data set that may apply to this data.</li>
	<li>Find out if the data has been used before. Is your analysis adding any new insights about the data or are you simply repeating something that has already been done?</li>
</ol>

<p>Answers to these questions could affect the way you utilize the data by changing the scope of your analysis or prompting you to look for additional data. They may even cause you to throw out your original research question.</p>

<p>Before you begin your analysis, remember to document your process and use of the data, including noting down administrative details such as licensing rights, communication with the data owners, data storage and retention. This is be helpful when you wish to recreate your analysis or need to retrace your activities at a later time. If you intend to share your results or findings in the future, do not forget to include any additional products (codebook, additional data sources) that result from your analytical tasks. Your careful documentation will provide evidence to other researchers that your analysis was conducted properly and allow them to build on your data findings.</p>

<h2>Giving Credit to External Data Sources</h2>

<p>Crediting the source of your external data set is a critical aspect of your work. Not only is it the morally right thing to do, but ethical research guidelines state that crediting sources is mandatory for any type of research. So always make sure that you give sufficient credit to any external data that you use by providing citations.</p>

<p>The goal of citing is to provide the reader with enough information to find the data that you have accessed and used. Cite your data sources using existing citation style manuals (APA, MLA, Chicago, Turabian, Harvard). Unlike published items such as articles or books, citing a data set varies a great deal from style to style.</p>

<p>As a general rule all styles require the author and title. In addition, editors, producer or distributor information (location and publication date), access date (which is the date when you first viewed the data), details about the data set (e.g., unique identifier, edition and material type) and the URL may be needed. For government data sets, use the name of the department, committee or agency as the group / corporate author.</p>

<p>For example, the <em>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</em>, 6th edition, (APA style manual in short) cites census data the following way:</p>

<div data-type="example">
<p>U.S. Bureau of the Census. (2013). Annual Survey of Public Employment and Payroll,<br />
2012 [Data File]. Retrieved from<br />
<a class="link " href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/annual-survey-of-public-employment-and-payrol" target="_blank">http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/annual-survey-of-public-employment-and-payrol</a></p>
</div>

<p>while the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Paper, 7th edition, (MLA style manual in short) cites the same census data as:</p>

<div data-type="example">
<p>U.S. Bureau of the Census. Annual Survey of Public Employment and Payroll, 2012.<br />
Web. March 7 2014.</p>
</div>

<p>In many instances data repositories and organizations have their own citation guidelines and provide ready citations that you can use &ldquo;as is&rdquo;. The Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), The National Centre for Health Statistics, Dryad, PANGAEA and Roper Center Data all provide guidelines for citing their data sets.</p>
