    <h1>Getting Data Ready for Use</h1>

    <p>After you’ve collected the items you want to use for your recipe, there’s another important step before you can put everything together.  This is the prep step, where you chop, wash, grind, and otherwise get your ingredients ready.  Many of us, especially those without finely honed knife skills, rather dislike this step; however, it is necessary and extremely important.  Washing vegetables isn’t much fun, but if you’ve ever had a dish where it was clear they weren’t properly washed, you know firsthand how much the end result can suffer if this step is done poorly or skipped altogether!</p>
    
    <p>As in cooking, many also dislike the preparation/cleaning step when working with data but it is necessary.   You can’t just grab the data, throw it into a visualization, and expect it to come out just right.  If you want to create the best graphics you can, you need to make sure your data is prepared correctly.  Some of your data may need to be separated into different groups, some may need converting, and some may need to be cleaned, like the vegetables. </p> 
    

    <p>In this section, we’ll talk about some of the common preparation and cleaning tasks encountered in working with data, and about ways that you can potentially decrease the amount of time you’ll need to spend doing them.  No matter how you slice it, if you get your data set up in the right way, it will make everything a go a lot smoother when you get to the visualization stage.</p>
