  <h1>Preparing Data for Use</h1>
  <p>After you’ve collected all the items you think you want to use for your recipe, there’s another important step that happens before you can put everything together.  This is the prep step, where you chop, wash, grind, measure, and do whatever else needs to be done to your ingredients to get them ready.  Many of us, especially those without finely honed knife skills, rather dislike this step; however, it is necessary and extremely important.  Washing vegetables isn’t much fun, but if you’ve ever had a dish where it was clear they weren’t properly washed, you know firsthand how much the end result can suffer if this step is done poorly or worse, skipped altogether!</p>
  <p>As in cooking, many also dislike the preparation/cleaning step when working with data but it is quite necessary.   You can’t just grab the data, throw it into a visualization, and expect it to come out just right.  If you want to create the tastiest graphics you can, you need to take the time to make sure your data is prepared correctly.  Some of your data may need to be separated into different groups, and some may need to be cleaned, like the vegetables. </p> 
  <p>Depending on what type of data you need, if don’t want to (or don’t have time to) deal with dirty data, you might be able go to certain sources to acquire data that are already prepared, cleaned, and ready to go. However, just like when you buy pre-chopped, pre-washed veggies at the store, these data are sometimes more expensive to acquire than raw data you need to work with more.  You might decide the time and effort you save are worth that cost or the overall cost, when you factor in your own time and effort, might turn out to be fairly equivalent.  </p>
  <p>In this section, we’ll talk about some of the common preparation and cleaning tasks encountered in working with data, and about ways that you can potentially decrease the amount of time you’ll need to spend doing them.  No matter how you slice it, if you get your data set up in the right way, it will make everything a go a lot smoother when you get to the visualization stage.</p>
