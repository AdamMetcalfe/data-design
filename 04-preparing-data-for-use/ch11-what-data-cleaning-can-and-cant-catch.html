<h1>What Data Cleaning Can and Can't Catch</h1>
</header>

<section data-type="sect1">
<p>Now that we have understood what data cleaning is for and what methods and approaches there are to bring our dataset into shape, there is yet the question of what the cleaning can and can&rsquo;t catch.</p>

<p>A general rule for cleaning a data set where variables are the columns and the rows represent the records states:</p>

<ul>
	<li>if the number of incorrect or missing values in a row is greater than the number of correct values, it is recommended to exclude that row.</li>
	<li>if the number of incorrect or missing values in a column is greater than the number of correct values in that column, it is recommended to exclude that column.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be made clear that exclusion is not the same as deletion! &nbsp;If you decide that you don&rsquo;t want to include a row or column in your analysis or visualization, you should set them aside in a separate data set rather than deleting them altogether. &nbsp;Once data is permanently deleted, you can&rsquo;t retrieve it, and you may find a way to fill in missing values or fix incorrect values later on. &nbsp;Unless you are absolutely certain that you will not use a record or the information from a gathered variable again, do not just delete it.</p>

<p>In the last few chapters, we have talked about several different checking processes for data cleaning and have seen the types of problems they can help identify and fix. &nbsp;When we&rsquo;re searching for errors and mistakes, we are able to detect these types of potential problems:</p>

<ul>
	<li>inconsistent labels, misspellings, errors in punctuation</li>
	<li>outliers, <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#data-invalid">invalid values</a> , and extreme values</li>
	<li>data that aren&rsquo;t internally consistent within the dataset (e.g. 200 lbs. of morphine)</li>
	<li>lack or excess of data</li>
	<li>odd patterns in distributions</li>
	<li>missing values</li>
</ul>

<p>What we haven&rsquo;t talked a lot about yet is what data cleaning can&rsquo;t catch. &nbsp;There may be incorrect values that are within the range of the data but that still make complete sense. &nbsp;For example, if someone enters the number 45 instead of 54 into your data set and your valid range of numbers is 0-100, it will be unlikely that you&rsquo;ll catch that error unless that field is one that you&rsquo;re cross-checking with another field or you&rsquo;re verifying the information with an outside source record.</p>

<p>Similar to that, you may be receiving information from an online survey form and the person filling it out may have selected the button for &ldquo;Strongly Agree&rdquo; when they actually meant to select &ldquo;Strongly Disagree.&rdquo; &nbsp;Again, unless this answer is somehow cross-checked with another variable or source, you will have no easy way to detect this error. &nbsp;Sometimes this type of error is more critical than others. &nbsp;If a person selects &ldquo;Strongly Agree&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Agree&rdquo; on an opinion survey, that is unlikely to have the same impact on end results as if someone accidentally marks the wrong gender on a form for a research study where you are using gender as a grouping category for treatment assignments.</p>

<p>Data cleaning also can&rsquo;t tell if a missing value is true missing (i.e. the question was accidentally skipped or the data was not collected for some reason) or the question was purposely skipped (i.e. decline to answer) unless &ldquo;Decline to answer&rdquo; was an answer choice. &nbsp;This is relevant in some cases (particularly in demographics), and in others, you may decide to just treat both as missing data. &nbsp;This is why, as mentioned before, you need to include a &ldquo;Prefer not to answer&rdquo; choice for any question of a personal nature where you want to know if the data are truly missing, since some people may actively choose to not answer questions about race/ethnicity, income, political or sexual orientation, etc.</p>

<p>Finally and importantly, normal data cleaning can&rsquo;t tell you if data were made up. &nbsp;There are statistical analyses you can run that will point to potential fraudulent data patterns, but regular data checking can&rsquo;t tell you for sure if a record was falsified. &nbsp;However, if you have tracking and restricted access permissions on the data set, you can tell when records were added, altered, or deleted. &nbsp;{I feel like we should say something more concrete about this but I don&rsquo;t know what}</p>
