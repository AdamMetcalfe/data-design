<h1>Descriptive vs. inferential statistics</h1>
</header>

<section data-type="sect1">
<p>In the last chapter we talked about different types of data and what you can and can't do with each. Now let's do the same thing with different types of <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#statistics">statistics</a>. Many people express fear at the mention of that word, but statistics have a reputation for being a lot more frightening than they actually are. In fact, you probably already know more about them than you think you do and by the end of this book, you'll know even more than that.</p>

<p>There are two big groups of <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#statistics-applied">applied statistics</a> - descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Both are well-named; they do exactly what they say they do. Descriptive statistics describe data we've already collected, while procedures in inferential statistics let us use that information to make inferences about data that we haven't gathered yet.</p>

<p>Say we're working in a large city and we want to get opinions of local elementary school kids about two new healthy lunch items to assess if either, or both, would be sensible additions to the permanent cafeteria menu. There are too many students to talk to all of them, so we ask a small group at several schools in the area. Descriptive statistics tell us what the kids we talked to said, while the inferential statistics we calculate help us predict what the students across the city would probably say, if their opinions were reasonably similar to those of the kids we spoke to.</p>

<h1>Descriptive statistics</h1>

<p>There are really basic <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#statistics-descriptive">descriptive statistics</a>, like counts and percentages. The most basic piece of data is N, which is just the overall count or the total number of observations in the data set. If there are different groups within the data, each has its own count, which we call lowercase n. Each n is a certain percentage (%) of N.</p>

<p>In the pie chart below, you can see the total N, the n of each group, and what % of the total N each little n is.</p>

<p>For numeric variables, there are other descriptive statistics that require additional calculation but give us more insight into our data. The mode is the simplest of these, and it's just the result that shows up most frequently in your data set. If you recorded the number of red lights you hit each day on the way to work for a month and it was 3 more often than any other number, then 3 would be the mode. The mode makes the most sense to report for discrete numeric data. You <i>can</i> report it for continuous data, but unless the data is rounded into a functionally discrete form, like we do with dates or age, you're unlikely to end up with observations that occur much more frequently than others in the data set.</p>

<p>Two other commonly reported descriptive statistics are the mean and median. These are both called measures of central tendency because they tell you where the middle of your data set lies. The <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#mean">mean</a> is the arithmetic middle, or the average, of the data. That is, you add up all the values and divide by the n that went into the total. The <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#median">median</a> is a different way to measure what the center of the data is and it is literally in the middle of the data. If you line the observations up from smallest to largest and then count off from the ends, the median is the value of the observation that is right smack in the middle. (If you have an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.)</p>

<p>Each of these has advantages and disadvantages. The mean takes the values of all the observations into account, which can be both good and bad. It reflects the overall values but can also be highly skewed by extreme results on either end of the scale. The median is less influenced by extreme observations but also does not take the values of the variable into account, as it is only based on their ranking within the data set.</p>

<p>Take the following example of test scores:</p>

<figure><img alt="Students surveyed" src="../images/sections/02/exam-scores.png" /></figure>

<p>Most of the scores on this test were greater than 70. There were a few between 50 and 69, and then 3 students received a zero for missing the test without being excused. In this example, the median of the data is 83, which is reasonably representative of overall student performance on the test. The mean, however, is much lower at 73.4 because it factors in the three scores of 0. If you were to look at the actual data, you would see that 18 of the 25 students (72%) got a score higher than 73.4, so the mean isn't a great indicator of where the center of this data is.</p>

<p>Since the mean and median can differ greatly but each provides important information, it is common to report the numbers together. That way, you're also letting your audience know if there were more extreme observations on one side of the data set than the other.</p>

<p>In the test scores, the three students who got a 0 pulled the average of the class down, so the mean was less than the median. If instead most of the class had done very poorly, but a few students got perfect scores, the mean would be greater than the median because the perfect scores would have brought the average up. If there are a similar number of equally extreme observations on both ends of the data, they'll balance out and the values of your mean and median will be fairly close. If you don't really have any extreme observations, your mean and median will also be fairly close, since there isn't a strong pull on the mean from either direction. In fact, if we remove the students who got 0, the mean and median of the remaining scores are quite close at 83.4 and 84.5, respectively, since there are no more extreme low scores pulling on the mean from the left side.</p>

<p>There are also measures of dispersion that tell you how spread out your data are (or aren't). The simplest of these is <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#range">range</a>, which just lets you know how far apart the largest and smallest values in your data set are. You may also have heard of <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#variance">variance</a> or standard deviation, which give you a sense of how far on average your values are from the mean of the data set.</p>

<p>Let's look at the test score example again:</p>

<figure><img alt="Standard deviation of test scores" src="" /></figure>

<p>Since the lowest test score was 0 and the highest was 100, our range would be {0 - 100}. The <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#deviation-standard">standard deviation</a> of the data is 29.7 when you take the students who missed the test into account. However, if we remove these students, the standard deviation drops dramatically to 11.6, just as we saw a large change in the mean when we took these scores out. The standard deviation is also affected by extreme observations but differs from the mean in that these observations don't balance out if they're on opposite ends of the data. Since the standard deviation is an indicator of the spread of data, it only increases as the number of extreme observations goes up.</p>

<h1>Inferential statistics</h1>

<p>When you gather data, the set of data that you collect is called a <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#sample">sample</a>. You can use descriptive statistics to describe your sample as a whole or you can break your sample into groups and describe them separately.</p>

<p>In <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#statistics-inferential">inferential statistics</a>, we use the descriptive statistics we calculate about our and theories of <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#probability">probability</a> to make inferences about what we think is likely going on in the larger group we drew that sample from. In the example above, we talked about elementary school kids. In that example, it would not have been cost-effective or timely to try and gather data from all the kids in the whole city, so instead we used samples from the bigger group, which we call the <a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#population">population</a>.</p>

<p>There are a wide variety of inferential statistical tests and methods that we can use to make inferences about different population parameters. Here are some of the most commonly used.</p>

<p>We're not going to cover the calculation of inferential stats in depth here. Teaching even beginning inferential stats takes an entire textbook in itself, and our focus is on the data visualization process and the graph types we're covering later, which are descriptive in nature.</p>

<p>So why are we telling you about inferential statistics at all if we're not actually calculating them? Well, we want to help you learn to tell better stories with your data. The stories that you can tell with inferential statistics are different than those that you can tell with descriptive statistics alone. It's not uncommon to want to extrapolate more meaning from descriptive statistics than is proper, and we want to keep you from making that (sometimes very tempting) mistake!</p>
