    <h1>Descriptive vs. inferential statistics</h1>
  </header>

  <section data-type="sect1">
  <p>In the last chapter we talked about different types of data and what you can and can't do with each.  Now let's do the same thing with different types of statistics.  Many people express fear at the mention of that word, but statistics have a reputation for being a lot more frightening than they actually are.  In fact, you probably already know more about them than you think you do and by the end of this book, you'll know even more than that.</p>

  <p>There are two "flavors" of statistics, applied and theoretical.  Within applied statistics (we'll talk about theoretical stats later), there are two big groups - descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.  Both are well-named; they do exactly what they say they do.   Descriptive statistics describe data we've already collected, while procedures in inferential statistics let us use that information to make inferences about data that we haven't gathered yet.</p>

  <p>Say we're working in a large city and we want to get opinions of local elementary school kids about two new healthy lunch items to assess if either, or both, would be sensible additions to the permanent cafeteria menu.  There are too many students to talk to all of them, so we ask a small group at several schools in the area.  Descriptive statistics tell us what the kids we talked to said, while the inferential statistics we calculate help us predict what the students across the city would probably say, if their opinions were reasonably similar to those of the kids we spoke to.</p>

  <h1>Descriptive statistics</h1>

  <p>There are really basic descriptive statistics, like counts and percentages.  The absolutely most basic piece of data is N, which is just the overall count or the total number of observations in the data set.  If there are different groups within the data, like boys and girls, each has its own count, which we call lowercase n.  Each n is a certain percentage (%) of N. </p>
  <p>In the pie chart below, you can see the total N, the n of each group, and what % of the total N each little n is.</p>

  <p>For continuous variables, there are other descriptive statistics that require additional calculation but give us more insight into our data.  You  might have heard of some of these before, like the mean or median.  These are both called measures of central tendency because they let us know where the middle of our data set lies.  The mean is the arithmetic middle, or average, of the data.  That is, you add up all the values and divide by the n that went into the total.  When people talk about "the average", they're usually referring to the mean.  It's not the only kind average though!  The median is a different sort of average and it is literally the the middle of the dataset.  If you line the observations up from smallest to largest and then count off from the ends, the median is the value of the observation that is right smack in the middle of the dataset.</p>  
  <p>Each of these has advantages and disadvantages.  The mean takes the values of all the observations into account, which can be both good and bad.  It reflects the overall values but can also be highly skewed by extreme results on either end of the scale. The median is less influenced by extreme observations but also does not take the values of the variable into account, as it is only based on their ranking within the data set.</p>
  <p>Take the following example of test scores:</p>

  <p>There are also measures of dispersion that tell you how spread out your data are (or aren't). The simplest of these is range, which just lets you know how far apart the largest and smallest values in your data set are.  You may also have heard of variance or standard deviation, which give you a sense of how far on average your values are from the mean of the data set.</p>
  <p>Let's look at the test score example again:</p>

  <h1>Inferential statistics</h1>

  <p>When you gather data, the set of data that you collect is called a sample.  You can use descriptive statistics to  describe your sample as a whole or you can break your sample into groups and describe them separately.</p>

  <p>In inferential statistics, we use the descriptive statistics we calculate about our and theories of probability to make predictions about what we think is likely going on in the larger group we drew that sample from.  In the example above, we talked about elementary school kids.  In that example, it would not have been cost-effective or timely to try and gather data from all the kids in the whole city, so instead we used samples from the bigger group, which we call the population.</p>

  <p>There are a wide variety of inferential statistical tests that we can use to make inferences about different population parameters.</p>

  <p>Now, we're not going to cover the calculation of inferential stats in depth.  Teaching even beginning inferential stats takes an entire textbook in itself, and our focus is on the data visualization process and the graph types we're covering later, which are descriptive in nature.</p>

  <p>So why are we telling you about inferential statistics at all if we're not actually learning to calculate them here?  Well, we want to help you learn to tell better stories with your data.  The stories that you can tell with inferential statistics are different than those that you can tell with descriptive statistics alone.  It's not uncommon to want to extrapolate more meaning from descriptive statistics than is proper, and we want to keep you from making that (sometimes very tempting) mistake!  give example here of poll or survey numbers.</p>

  <p>We mentioned above that we'd talk a little about theoretical statistics later.  The field of theoretical statistics uses rules of probability to figure out what would happen, statistically speaking, in different situations.  It answers questions like: how many heads can you expect if you flip a coin 10 times?  100?  A million? What if you could flip a coin an infinite number of times?  Statistical theory is what allows us to take those descriptive statistics we calculate and use them to do inferential statistics.  Without statistical theory, we'd only ever be able to  describe the data we collected and couldn't use it to try to figure out what's going on with the bigger picture, which would be limiting indeed!     </p>
