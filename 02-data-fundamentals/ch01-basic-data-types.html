<h2>A Qualitative Memory</h2>

<p>Imagine yourself on a trip to the grocery store. You have a cart full of items and as you head to the checkout, you briefly scan the lines. Mentally, you begin to categorize the lines into two groups: long lines and short lines. Perhaps your mind wanders a bit and you describe the two types of lines. Long lines: frustrating, takes a long time, lots of items per person. Short lines: convenient, quick, very few items per person. The information you&rsquo;ve collected in this situation is what is known as <a class="glossterm" data-type="xref" href="#data-qualitative"><em class="xref ">qualitative data</em></a>. Items making up qualitative data use words to categorize or describe your observations.</p>

<p>These kinds of observations are sometimes called <a class="glossterm xref " data-type="xref" href="#data-categorical"><em>categorical data</em></a> because they often end up being grouped into, well, categories. We form these kinds of groupings all the time: In the grocery store example, you might notice that the other people in line are women or men, shopping alone or with children, or choosing paper bags over plastic. We&rsquo;re also not limited to only two categories. Perhaps you ask your friends to tell you their favorite beverage - some might say coffee, others tea, still others soda or water. There&rsquo;s no limit to how many categories we can create!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are we still talking about categories,&rdquo; you ask, carrying grocery bags into the house. &ldquo;Why does this matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;re confident with qualitative data, let's take a look at its sibling, <a class="glossterm" data-type="xref" href="#data-quantitative"><em class="xref ">quantitative data</em></a>. Quantitative data involves numbers; that is to say, it involves things that can be counted or measured. Instead of simply describing shoppers as those with kids and those without, what if you counted how many kids they had? Instead of having two categories &ldquo;Children&rdquo; and &ldquo;No Children,&rdquo; you now have the number of kids: 0, 1, 2, and so on. You may notice that this is awfully similar to categories, and you&rsquo;d be right. When we&rsquo;re essentially giving each number its own category like this, it&rsquo;s known as a <a class="glossterm" data-type="xref" href="#scale-discrete"><em>discrete scale</em></a>.</p>

<p>Say there are five traffic lights between the store and your home. Each time you make the drive, you count how many of them are red. Sometimes, maddeningly, every single light turns red just as you approach it, - that&rsquo;s one for the &ldquo;5&rdquo; category. Other days, every light is green, and you happily breeze through in half the time - that trip goes under &ldquo;0.&rdquo; Over time you&rsquo;ll be able to see from this quantitative data how many lights are likely to be red when you leave the house, and have a better estimate of how long the drive will take.</p>

<figure><img src="../images/sections/02/red-lights.png" /></figure>

<p>Both of these examples involve counting a single thing - a child, a red light. Notice how this is a little different than what we did earlier with the qualitative data. There, we were counting occurrences of multiple things, like all those beverages. We could turn the beverage question into quantitative data by replacing &ldquo;What is your favorite beverage&rdquo; with, &ldquo;How many cups of coffee do you drink a day?&rdquo; Any time we gather quantitative data by counting like this, our data is thought of as being on that discrete scale. In other words, there&rsquo;s no partial kids, mostly-red lights, or half-cups of coffee.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another way to gather quantitative data that involves taking a measurement. Data collected this way is on a <a class="glossterm" data-type="xref" href="#scale-continuous"><em>continuous</em></a> scale, which means we can have anything in between two numbers as well. Your car takes a measurement like this when it tells you how fast you&rsquo;re driving. Even though the speed limit might suddenly get lower, the car gradually slows down instead of jumping directly to that new speed.</p>

<figure><img src="../images/sections/02/driving-speed.png" /></figure>

<p>Temperature and distance work this way too - even though we might round the numbers to make them easier to show, we know that the actual values can be anywhere in between.</p>

<p>Think back to the last time you filled out a form, any form. You probably answered some descriptive questions, like, &ldquo;Why did you come here today?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s your qualitative data&mdash;new people and return people. Another one might have asked you to rate your satisfaction: Very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, not at all satisfied, and so on. Again, qualitative, grouping into categories. That satisfaction question can be made quantitative, however, by asking you to rate your satisfaction on a scale of 1-10. There&rsquo;s not usually spots for &ldquo;7.5&rdquo; or 3.14159,&rdquo; so this quantitative data would be on a discrete scale. Finally, you might have been asked for your age. While we typically round this number, our age increases on a continuous scale as each second ticks by (ack!).</p>

<p>Making these kinds of distinctions before collecting data is important, because it will determine what you will be able to do with it later. Qualitative data like biological sex can only be reported in words: we had female and male; there were red, yellow, and blue. We can convert qualitative data like this to quantitative data by counting it: 52 female, 48 male; 7 red, 13 yellow, 5 blue. Since quantitative data deals in numbers, we can use mathematical operations on it to get even more information. There are more yellows than reds or blues. If every person puts how old they are on our form, we can find out the average age of our group.</p>

<p>Performing these kinds of operations on our data is called <em>statistics</em>. Don&rsquo;t scream and run away just yet: we&rsquo;ll be going over it in the next section.</p>
