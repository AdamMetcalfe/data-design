  <h1>Data Fundamentals</h1>
  <p>When you make a recipe, you follow a number of consistent steps.  You figure out what ingredients you need, you gather them, you get them ready to use in your dish, and then you make the recipe and present your finished result.</p>
  <p>Creating a data visualization works a lot like this. You decide what data you need, you collect it, you prepare and clean it for use, and then you make the visualization and present your finished result.</p>
  <p>When you’re cooking or baking, it helps to know a little about what each kind of ingredient does, so you know what you can do with it.  For example, salt and sugar look similar but achieve very different results!  In this section, we’ll talk about what the basic ingredient groups of data are and what can and can’t be done with them so you have a sense of how to properly work with them later on.</p>
